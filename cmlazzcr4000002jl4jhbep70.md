## Why recovery tracking matters

Recovery from injury is rarely linear. Pain levels fluctuate, good days alternate with setbacks, and progress can feel invisible when measured against yesterday. Structured tracking transforms this uncertain experience into a documented trajectory that shows real trends over time. When you look at a month of data, improvement that was invisible day-to-day becomes clear.

Recovery documentation also serves practical purposes. Insurance claims, return-to-work plans, and treatment justifications all require evidence of ongoing symptoms and functional progress. A structured pain diary created during recovery provides this evidence contemporaneously—far more credible than retrospective reports.

## What to track during recovery

During recovery, track the basics—pain intensity, location, and quality—plus recovery-specific data: functional milestones (first day you could walk to the mailbox, first day you could work a full shift), activity tolerance (how long you can stand, sit, or drive before pain increases), and any setbacks (activities that caused regression, new symptoms, or flare-ups).

Medication changes are particularly important to document during recovery. As your condition improves, medication adjustments should be tracked alongside symptom levels to show whether improvements are genuine healing or simply better pain management. This distinction matters clinically and for insurance purposes.

## Tracking non-linear progress

Recovery setbacks are normal and do not mean you are not healing. A week of increased pain after attempting a new activity does not erase months of progress—but without tracked data, it can feel that way. Your pain log provides objective evidence of your overall trajectory, helping you and your care team distinguish between temporary setbacks and genuine regression.

PainTracker's trend visualisations show your recovery arc: the overall trajectory from injury through healing, with flares and setbacks visible as temporary deviations from the improving baseline. This big-picture view is therapeutically valuable and clinically informative.

## Documentation for return-to-work planning

Return-to-work planning requires evidence of functional capacity that goes beyond pain intensity numbers. Your employer, your doctor, and your WorkSafeBC representative all need to understand what you can and cannot do. Structured tracking of functional milestones, activity tolerance, and work-specific capacity provides this evidence in a format that all parties can interpret.

PainTracker's exports can document your functional progression alongside pain levels, showing reviewers that you are actively recovering and that your reported limitations are consistent with your daily tracking data. This consistency between self-report and tracked data strengthens your credibility throughout the return-to-work process.

## When to stop tracking

There is no mandatory end date for recovery tracking. Some people stop when they feel their condition has stabilised. Others continue indefinitely because the data remains useful for managing residual symptoms or chronic pain. If your injury has resolved, you can export a final comprehensive report and stop tracking with confidence that your recovery is documented.

If symptoms persist beyond expected recovery timelines, your tracked data becomes invaluable. It documents the full timeline from injury through recovery plateau, providing your care team and insurers with evidence that ongoing symptoms are real, consistent, and documented from the beginning.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When should I start tracking after an injury?

Start as soon as possible—ideally the day of injury. Early documentation establishes your baseline and creates a continuous record. PainTracker requires no setup time, so you can begin immediately.

### Is it normal for recovery tracking to show ups and downs?

Yes. Recovery is rarely linear. Setbacks, flares, and daily fluctuations are normal. What matters is the overall trend over weeks and months, which PainTracker's trend visualisations make clear.
