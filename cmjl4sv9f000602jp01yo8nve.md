WorkSafeBC paperwork is hard enough when you’re injured.

The claim process often asks for consistent, specific documentation over weeks or months: pain intensity, functional limits, triggers, medications, and how symptoms change over time.

When that data lives in scattered notes, calendars, and memory, the result is predictable:

* Missing days (especially on the hardest days)
    
* Inconsistent detail
    
* Hours of formatting and reformatting
    
* Stress spikes from paperwork pressure
    

This post shows what “good” looks like when the burden is reduced—without sacrificing privacy.

## The Challenge (Common Problems)

Typical documentation pain points we repeatedly hear:

* Logs spread across notebooks, phone notes, and messages
    
* Inconsistent tracking cadence
    
* Difficulty showing patterns (work activities, routines, weather, sleep)
    
* Hard to compile into a clean, chronological packet
    
* Repeated requests to clarify or expand documentation
    

A realistic time cost (composite estimate): **~15–20 hours** of compiling and formatting across a 2–3 month claim window.

## The Solution: Pain Tracker Pro (Local-First Workflow)

Pain Tracker Pro is designed to keep health data **on your device** by default and to produce **exportable reports** when you decide to share.

### Before

1. Track symptoms whenever you remember
    
2. Later: gather notes and reconstruct timelines
    
3. Reformat into something readable
    
4. Repeat as new requests come in
    

### After

1. 2-minute daily check-ins using a structured pain entry
    
2. Optional context tracking (e.g., activities, triggers)
    
3. Generate a WorkSafeBC-oriented report export
    
4. Review the PDF, share only what’s needed

In a composite scenario, **report generation** can be **minutes**, with the remaining time spent on review and any additional context you choose to include.

## Composite Results (Illustrative)

These are **illustrative** metrics that reflect the *direction* of improvement we see when people switch from ad-hoc notes to structured tracking:

* Tracking consistency: **~65% → ~90%+** of days with entries
    
* Required fields: **partial → more complete**, because the entry is structured
    
* Patterns/triggers: **hard to argue → easier to explain** with consistent timestamps
    
* Packaging: **manual → exportable** (PDF/CSV/JSON)
    

## What Makes the Difference

### 1) Structured data collection (without medical overreach)

Instead of:

> “Back hurts today, 7/10.”

A structured entry captures *enough detail to be useful* without forcing clinical language:

* Pain location(s): selected from a body map
    
* Intensity: 0–10
    
* Quality: selected descriptors (e.g., sharp / aching)
    
* Triggers: selected or freeform (e.g., prolonged sitting)
    
* Functional impact: what you couldn’t do today
    
* Medications: optional, user-entered
    
* Notes: optional, user-controlled
    

### 2) Local pattern tools (not cloud AI)

Pain Tracker Pro includes local, rule-based analytics to help you spot trends:

* Time-of-day patterns
    
* Recurring triggers
    
* Correlations between tracked factors (where available)
    

These tools run locally and are intended to help you **describe patterns**, not to replace clinical advice.

### 3) WorkSafeBC-oriented export (you control scope)

The WorkSafeBC export is designed to produce a clean report packet:

* Chronological pain log for a selected date range
    
* Functional limitations summary
    
* Medication tracking summary (if you tracked it)
    
* Trend notes and patterns (where available)
    

You choose what timeframe to export and you can review the output before sharing.

### 4) Privacy-preserved evidence

Local-first design means:

* No cloud copies by default
    
* No third-party analytics for your pain data (optional anonymous usage analytics may be enabled by the deployment)
    
* You control what you export and share
    

## Before vs After (Illustrative)

**Before (typical)**

```plaintext
Handwritten / scattered notes:
- Mar 15: Back hurts, couldn’t work
- Mar 20: Still bad
- Mar 28: Doctor visit
- [Missing many days]
```

**After (export packet)**

```plaintext
Structured report export:
- Consistent date range with entries
- Clear timestamps and fields
- Functional impact captured over time
- Optional summaries and patterns
```

## How to Use This Workflow (Practical Steps)

### Week 1–2: Baseline

1. Start tracking daily (aim for “most days,” not perfection)
    
2. Record functional limits in plain language
    
3. Track relevant triggers (work activities, routines)
    

### Week 3–12: Consistency

1. Keep entries short to reduce burnout
    
2. Focus on repeatable signals (same fields, same scale)
    
3. Update context when it changes (meds, work duties)
    

### Claim documentation time: Export

1. Open Reports
    
2. Select your date range (often 60–90 days)
    
3. Generate WorkSafeBC export
    
4. Review for accuracy and remove anything you don’t want to share
    

## FAQ

**Is this accepted by WorkSafeBC?**

Pain Tracker Pro generates documentation in a structured, chronological format that’s commonly requested for ongoing pain documentation.

We are **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to WorkSafeBC**, and we can’t guarantee acceptance outcomes. Always follow guidance from your adjudicator and healthcare provider.

**Can I use this for an existing claim?**

Yes. You can start tracking now and export documentation for ongoing reporting needs. Historical reconstruction still requires manual entry.

**What if I miss days?**

The export includes whatever data exists in the selected date range. More consistency generally makes patterns clearer, but partial data can still help.

## Getting Started

* Visit https://paintracker.app (no signup required)
    
* Complete your first entry (about 2 minutes)
    
* When needed, export a WorkSafeBC-oriented PDF from Reports
