## The detail dilemma

Pain diaries fail for two opposite reasons: too little detail produces data that clinicians cannot use, and too much detail creates a tracking burden that leads to abandonment. The goal is not maximum detail—it is optimal detail: capturing the data points that are clinically meaningful while keeping the daily effort sustainable over months and years.

Research on patient-reported outcome measures consistently shows that compliance drops sharply as tracking burden increases. A diary that takes three minutes per entry will be abandoned within weeks by most users. One that takes thirty seconds will be maintained indefinitely. The clinical value of consistent thirty-second entries far exceeds that of sporadic three-minute entries.

## Essential data points every entry needs

Four data points form the irreducible minimum of a clinically useful pain diary: date and time, pain intensity on a 0–10 scale, primary pain location, and pain quality (aching, burning, stabbing, etc.). These take seconds to record using structured inputs and provide the foundation for trend analysis, medication assessment, and clinical communication.

PainTracker captures these essentials through a slider (intensity), body map tap (location), and descriptor selection (quality), with the timestamp recorded automatically. The design principle is that the minimum viable entry should require no typing and fewer than four taps.

## Valuable additions worth the effort

Beyond the minimum, three additional data points substantially increase clinical value without significantly increasing burden: medications taken, functional impact, and one brief contextual note. Recording medications reveals treatment-response patterns. Functional impact gives clinicians the real-world context they need. A brief note ("couldn't sleep," "walked 2km today," "weather change") captures triggers and context that structured fields miss.

PainTracker presents these as optional fields that follow the essential inputs. On a good day, you might skip them. On a day when something noteworthy happened, you can add context in a few seconds. This tiered approach means your diary always has the essentials and often has richer context, without ever requiring a specific level of detail.

## When more detail helps

Certain clinical situations warrant temporarily increased tracking detail. When starting a new medication, track medication timing alongside pain levels at multiple points during the day to capture onset, peak effect, and wear-off patterns. When investigating triggers, add systematic notes about activities, food, weather, and stress levels for two to four weeks.

After diagnostic assessments or treatment changes, your clinician might request specific data. A good pain diary app should make it easy to increase detail temporarily without permanently raising the daily burden. PainTracker's optional fields and tagging system support this kind of temporary deep-dive.

## When less detail is better

During severe flares, cognitive capacity and motor function may be significantly limited. A pain diary that demands detailed entries during your worst moments is poorly designed. PainTracker's minimal entry path—a single slider swipe—ensures that even on your worst days, you can record something meaningful.

For long-term tracking (months to years), simpler entries also produce cleaner trend data. Daily entries with consistent essential data points create smooth trend lines that reveal seasonal patterns, medication effectiveness over time, and the natural trajectory of your condition. Over-detailed entries add noise without necessarily adding clinical signal at this timescale.

## Designing your personal tracking protocol

Start with the essentials and track for two weeks. Review your data and ask: is there a pattern I cannot see because I am missing a specific data point? If so, add that one field. After another two weeks, reassess. This iterative approach builds a personalised tracking protocol that captures what matters for your specific condition without unnecessary burden.

Remember that consistency trumps completeness. A month of minimal daily entries is more clinically valuable than a month of entries that vary wildly between exhaustive and absent. Set a sustainable baseline and add detail selectively when clinical questions demand it.
