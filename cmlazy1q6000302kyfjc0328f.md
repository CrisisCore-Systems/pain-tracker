## Why a structured template matters

An unstructured pain diary quickly becomes a collection of inconsistent entries that are difficult to interpret. A structured template ensures that you capture the same data points each time, producing comparable records that reveal trends and support clinical decisions. The template defines what to record, not how you feel about it—consistency comes from structure, not discipline.

PainTracker provides a built-in template through its structured entry interface: intensity scale, body map, quality descriptors, timing, medications, functional impact, and optional notes. This approach combines the thoroughness of a clinical assessment tool with the accessibility of a daily journaling habit.

## Core elements of a pain diary entry

Every pain diary entry should capture at minimum: date and time, pain intensity on a consistent scale (0–10 is standard), primary pain location, and pain quality. These four data points take seconds to record and provide the foundation for meaningful trend analysis. Everything else is valuable but optional—a minimal entry is always better than a skipped day.

Expanding beyond the minimum, record: duration of pain, whether the pain radiates to other areas, medications taken (name, dose, timing), functional impact on daily activities, potential triggers you have noticed, and any interventions you attempted (rest, ice, stretching, etc.). This richer dataset allows more nuanced analysis and gives clinicians a multi-dimensional view of your condition.

PainTracker organises these elements into a flow that moves from quick-capture essentials (slider, body map tap, quality select) to optional enrichments (notes, tags, medication details). The interface design reflects the priority: capture something every day, capture everything when you can.

## Pain intensity scales explained

The 0–10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is the most widely used pain measurement tool in clinical practice. Zero represents no pain, ten represents the worst pain imaginable. Its simplicity makes it fast to use and universally understood by healthcare providers. PainTracker uses a visual slider that maps to the NRS, providing a tactile input that many users find more intuitive than selecting a number.

Consistency matters more than precision. A patient who rates their daily headache as a "4" every day and a flare as a "7" is providing useful relative data, even if another patient would rate the same sensations differently. The scale tracks your pain relative to your own experience, not against an objective standard.

## Body mapping for pain location

Written descriptions of pain location are often imprecise. "Lower back" might mean the lumbar spine, the sacroiliac joint, or the gluteal muscles—each suggesting different conditions and treatments. A visual body map lets you tap or click the exact area, producing location data that is unambiguous and clinically precise.

Recording whether pain is localised, diffuse, or radiating adds diagnostic value. Pain that radiates from the lower back down the leg suggests nerve involvement. Pain that is widespread and bilateral may suggest central sensitisation. PainTracker's body map captures location with enough specificity to support these distinctions.

## Tracking medications and interventions

Medication logging transforms your pain diary from a record of symptoms into a treatment effectiveness monitor. Recording what you took, when you took it, and how your pain responded creates a dataset that helps both you and your prescriber optimise your medication regimen.

Include over-the-counter medications, prescribed drugs, supplements, and non-pharmacological interventions like physiotherapy exercises, heat or cold application, and rest periods. This comprehensive tracking reveals which combinations of interventions actually help—information that is difficult to obtain from memory alone.

## Adapting the template to your condition

No single template is perfect for every pain condition. Migraine sufferers might add aura descriptions and light sensitivity ratings. Arthritis patients might track joint stiffness duration and grip strength. Fibromyalgia patients might include fatigue and cognitive fog scores alongside pain. PainTracker's tags and notes fields provide the flexibility to extend the standard template to your specific needs.

The key is to decide on your personal additions once and then use them consistently. A custom field that you track every day for a month is far more useful than one you remember intermittently. Start with the core template, add one or two condition-specific fields, and adjust after a few weeks of use.
