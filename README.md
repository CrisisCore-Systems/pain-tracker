## üö® Why Pain Tracker Exists

Pain is more than a number. Most apps oversimplify‚Äîthis one doesn't. We built **Pain Tracker** to **map pain in high resolution** for real-world recovery, backed by **WorkSafe BC reporting** and **security-focused engineering**.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status**: This project is in **early development** (v0.1.0-dev). While core features are functional and tested, dependency vulnerabilities are being actively addressed. See [Security Status](#-security-status) for details.

## üß± Architecture Overview

For a detailed exploration of storage design, background synchronization, PWA infrastructure, extensibility paths, and roadmap, see: [ARCHITECTURE_DEEP_DIVE.md](./ARCHITECTURE_DEEP_DIVE.md).

Key pillars: Offline-first resilience, event-driven sync, typed IndexedDB wrapper, prioritized queue processing, and forward-compatible shims (e.g., legacy `forcSync` ‚Üí `forceSync`).

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Status

**Current Security Posture**: CrisisCore Systems has implemented comprehensive security infrastructure, but the project currently has dependency vulnerabilities that require attention:

- ‚úÖ **Security Infrastructure**: Complete CI/CD security pipeline with CodeQL, SAST, and secret scanning
- ‚úÖ **Development Security**: Pre-commit hooks, vulnerability scanning, and security-focused code practices  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Dependencies**: 77 vulnerabilities in dev dependencies (73 critical, 1 high, 3 moderate)
- ‚úÖ **Production Safety**: Vulnerabilities are in development tools, not runtime dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Local Data Only**: No cloud storage or data transmission reduces attack surface

**Security Architecture**:

    B4[CrisisCore Vulnerability Rules]
  end

  B --> B1 --> B2 --> B3 --> B4
```

**Mitigation Plan**: Dependency updates are in progress. The security framework ensures that vulnerabilities in development tools don't affect the production application.

## üß© Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech Stack |
|-------|------------|
| **Frontend** | React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Headless UI |
| **Analytics** | Recharts, Chart.js, Custom Visualizations |
| **Validation** | Zod schemas for all inputs |
| **Testing** | Vitest, Testing Library, jsdom (128 tests) |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Dynamic Badges & Metrics

The badges at the top (tests, coverage %, security vulns, LOC, issues, PRs, commit activity) are generated via scripts in `scripts/` and JSON endpoints in `badges/` consumed by Shields.io.

Generation sources:
- `scripts/generate-test-badge.mjs`: counts tests via Vitest list / fallback static scan.
- `scripts/generate-coverage-badge.mjs`: reads `coverage/coverage-summary.json` (v8) after `vitest` run.
- `scripts/generate-security-badge.mjs`: parses `security-audit-report.json`.
- `scripts/generate-loc-badge.mjs`: fast LOC count over `.ts/.tsx` excluding vendor/output.
- `scripts/generate-bundle-badge.mjs`: parses esbuild metafile (or fallback) to compute total JS+CSS size.

Local refresh (PowerShell):

```powershell
npm run badge:all
```

Or individually:

```powershell
npm run badge:tests
npm run badge:loc
node scripts/generate-security-badge.mjs
```

Git pre-push hook (`.husky/pre-push`) auto-regenerates and amends/commits badge JSONs when pushing `main` to keep them current and reduce noisy commits.

Color thresholds:
- Coverage: 90+ brightgreen, 80‚Äì89 green, 70‚Äì79 yellowgreen, 60‚Äì69 yellow, 50‚Äì59 orange, <50 red.
- Tests count: scaled for current project size (>=250 brightgreen ... <60 lightgrey) ‚Äì adjust as suite grows.
- LOC: Favor smaller core; green under 1k, yellowgreen <5k, yellow <12k, orange <20k, red beyond.

Future ideas: bundle size badge (real metafile integration pending), mutation score, performance timing snapshots.

### DevOps & Security Tooling

- **DevOps**: GitHub Actions, Husky, CommitLint, Makefile workflows
- **Security**: CodeQL, npm audit, CrisisCore Gates, CSP headers

Mutation badge is updated via a weekly workflow; local runs will show "n/a" until a report exists.
