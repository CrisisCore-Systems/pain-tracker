## üö® Why Pain Tracker Exists  
Pain is more than a number. Most apps oversimplify‚Äîthis one doesn't.  
We built **Pain Tracker** to **map pain in high resolution** for real-world recovery,  
backed by **WorkSafe BC reporting** and **security-focused engineering**.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status**: This project is in **early development** (v0.1.0-dev). While core features are functional and tested, dependency vulnerabilities are being actively addressed. See [Security Status](#-security-status) for details.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Status  

**Current Security Posture**: CrisisCore Systems has implemented comprehensive security infrastructure, but the project currently has dependency vulnerabilities that require attention:

- ‚úÖ **Security Infrastructure**: Complete CI/CD security pipeline with CodeQL, SAST, and secret scanning
- ‚úÖ **Development Security**: Pre-commit hooks, vulnerability scanning, and security-focused code practices  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Dependencies**: 77 vulnerabilities in dev dependencies (73 critical, 1 high, 3 moderate)
- ‚úÖ **Production Safety**: Vulnerabilities are in development tools, not runtime dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Local Data Only**: No cloud storage or data transmission reduces attack surface
- ‚úÖ **SBOM Available**: Software Bill of Materials published for transparency ([View SBOM](security/sbom-latest.json))
- ‚úÖ **Documentation Validation**: Automated validation ensures documentation accuracy and completeness

**Secure Storage Implementation**:
- **Current Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for all sensitive data storage
- **Key Management**: Secure key rotation with fallback mechanisms
- **Encrypted Scope**: All pain assessments, personal data, and medical information
- **Fallback Behavior**: In-memory key cache when secure storage writes fail
- **Future Enhancement**: Optional IndexedDB layer for large encrypted datasets (planned)

**Security Architecture**:

## üîê Secure Storage Migration (LocalStorage ‚Üí secureStorage)

As of v0.1.0-dev, the application is migrating all sensitive and semi-sensitive browser persistence from raw `localStorage` keys to a hardened abstraction: `secureStorage`.

### Why This Change

- Centralized key validation + namespacing (`pt:` prefix) prevents collisions
- Future-proof encryption hook (already enabled for pain entries & sensitive identifiers)
- Deterministic testing: encryption shim replaced with no-op in Vitest global setup
- Uniform quota & error handling (graceful degradation + analytics hooks planned)

### Core Pieces

- `secureStorage.get/set/remove(key, { encrypt?: boolean })`
- Migration helpers in `src/lib/storage/migrations.ts`:
  - `migrateLegacyKey({ from, to, encrypt, transform, removeLegacy })`
  - `migrateLegacyKeys([{ from, to, encrypt }], options?)`
- Enhanced React hook: `useLocalStorage(key, initialValue, { secure, encrypt, namespace })`

### Typical Migration Pattern

```ts
import { secureStorage } from '@/lib/storage/secureStorage';
import { migrateLegacyKey } from '@/lib/storage/migrations';

// 1. Run once (component mount or early bootstrap)
migrateLegacyKey({
  from: 'legacy-onboarding-complete',
  to: 'onboardingComplete',
  encrypt: false,
  removeLegacy: true,
});

// 2. Use secureStorage everywhere after
const flag = secureStorage.get('onboardingComplete');
```

### Using the Hook Securely

```ts
const [entries, setEntries] = useLocalStorage('painEntries', [], {
  secure: true,      // uses secureStorage internally
  encrypt: true,     // apply encryption layer (test shim neutralizes)
  namespace: 'pt',   // optional explicit namespace override
});
```

### Encryption Notes

- Only applied to selected keys (pain entries, device identifiers, tokens)
- Transparent to callers; failures surface as normal storage errors
- Tests swap encryption functions with no-ops for deterministic snapshots

### Legacy Fallback Strategy

During migration we temporarily support reading the legacy key if the secure key is absent. After one successful write, the new key becomes the source of truth and (optionally) the legacy key is removed.

### Adding a New Persisted Key (Checklist)

1. Define semantic key name (camelCase) ‚Äì avoid user-supplied fragments
2. Decide if encryption needed (PII, health context, auth tokens = yes)
3. Add migration if replacing an old raw key
4. Use `useLocalStorage(..., { secure: true, encrypt })` or direct `secureStorage.set`
5. Write/update tests (use factories; encryption agnostic)
6. Avoid direct `window.localStorage` access outside controlled utilities

### Demo / Non-Production Scripts

Files in `public/pwa-demo.js` & `public/pwa-init.js` contain explicit comments noting they are demonstration-only and not production security models.

### Open Items

- Remaining raw usage candidate: `useWCBStorage.js` (planned evaluation)
- Future: optional IndexedDB layer for large encrypted blobs
