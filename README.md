## üö® Why Pain Tracker Exists  
Pain is more than a number. Most apps oversimplify‚Äîthis one doesn't.  
We built **Pain Tracker** to **map pain in high resolution** for real-world recovery,  
backed by **WorkSafe BC reporting** and **security-focused engineering**.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status**: This project is in **early development** (v0.1.0-dev). While core features are functional and tested, dependency vulnerabilities are being actively addressed. See [Security Status](#-security-status) for details.

## üîê Secure Storage Migration (LocalStorage ‚Üí secureStorage)

As of v0.1.0-dev, the application is migrating all sensitive and semi-sensitive browser persistence from raw `localStorage` keys to a hardened abstraction: `secureStorage`.

### Why This Change

- Centralized key validation + namespacing (`pt:` prefix) prevents collisions
- Future-proof encryption hook (already enabled for pain entries & sensitive identifiers)
- Deterministic testing: encryption shim replaced with no-op in Vitest global setup
- Uniform quota & error handling (graceful degradation + analytics hooks planned)

### Core Pieces

- `secureStorage.get/set/remove(key, { encrypt?: boolean })`
- Migration helpers in `src/lib/storage/migrations.ts`:
  - `migrateLegacyKey({ from, to, encrypt, transform, removeLegacy })`
  - `migrateLegacyKeys([{ from, to, encrypt }], options?)`
- Enhanced React hook: `useLocalStorage(key, initialValue, { secure, encrypt, namespace })`

### Typical Migration Pattern

```ts
import { secureStorage } from '@/lib/storage/secureStorage';
import { migrateLegacyKey } from '@/lib/storage/migrations';

// 1. Run once (component mount or early bootstrap)
migrateLegacyKey({
  from: 'legacy-onboarding-complete',
  to: 'onboardingComplete',
  encrypt: false,
  removeLegacy: true,
});

// 2. Use secureStorage everywhere after
const flag = secureStorage.get('onboardingComplete');
```

### Using the Hook Securely

```ts
const [entries, setEntries] = useLocalStorage('painEntries', [], {
  secure: true,      // uses secureStorage internally
  encrypt: true,     // apply encryption layer (test shim neutralizes)
  namespace: 'pt',   // optional explicit namespace override
});
```

### Encryption Notes

**Current Implementation Status**: 
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data (pain entries, device identifiers, tokens)
- **Key Management**: Browser-based key generation with secure random entropy
- **Scope**: Selective encryption applied to PII and health context data
- **Performance**: Encryption/decryption operations are lightweight and transparent to UI
- **Testing**: Test environment uses no-op encryption shims for deterministic snapshots

**Fallback Strategy**: 
- Primary: secureStorage with encryption layer
- Fallback 1: secureStorage without encryption (if encryption fails)
- Fallback 2: Legacy localStorage (during migration period only)
- Error Handling: Graceful degradation with user notification of storage limitations

**Key Rotation**: 
- Automated key rotation every 90 days for enhanced security
- Background process handles re-encryption of existing data
- Failure scenarios logged but don't interrupt user workflows
- Implementation: [`src/services/EncryptionService.ts`](src/services/EncryptionService.ts)

**Future Enhancements**:
- Hardware security module integration for key storage
- Zero-knowledge architecture for cloud sync
- Quantum-resistant encryption algorithms

### Legacy Fallback Strategy

During migration we temporarily support reading the legacy key if the secure key is absent. After one successful write, the new key becomes the source of truth and (optionally) the legacy key is removed.

### Adding a New Persisted Key (Checklist)

1. Define semantic key name (camelCase) ‚Äì avoid user-supplied fragments
2. Decide if encryption needed (PII, health context, auth tokens = yes)
3. Add migration if replacing an old raw key
4. Use `useLocalStorage(..., { secure: true, encrypt })` or direct `secureStorage.set`
5. Write/update tests (use factories; encryption agnostic)
6. Avoid direct `window.localStorage` access outside controlled utilities

### Demo / Non-Production Scripts

Files in `public/pwa-demo.js` & `public/pwa-init.js` contain explicit comments noting they are demonstration-only and not production security models.

### Open Items

- Remaining raw usage candidate: `useWCBStorage.js` (planned evaluation)
- Future: optional IndexedDB layer for large encrypted blobs
