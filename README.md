## üö® Why Pain Tracker exists

Pain is more than a number. Most apps oversimplify; this one doesn't.
Pain Tracker maps pain in high resolution for real-world recovery,
with WorkSafe BC reporting and security-focused engineering.

Status: early development (v0.1.0-dev). Core features are functional,
tested, and secure. We're remediating development dependency vulnerabilities.
See Security Status below.

## üß± Tech stack and architecture

See ARCHITECTURE_DEEP_DIVE.md for storage, background sync, PWA infra,
extensibility, and roadmap details.

Key pillars: offline-first resilience, event-driven sync, typed IndexedDB
wrapper, prioritized queue processing, and forward-compatible shims
(for example, legacy forcSync ‚Üí forceSync).

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|-----|
| Frontend | React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Headless UI |
| Analytics | Recharts, Chart.js, custom visualizations |
| Validation | Zod schemas for all inputs |
| Testing | Vitest, Testing Library, jsdom |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security status

Current posture: comprehensive security infrastructure is in place,
but some development dependency vulnerabilities remain.

- Security infrastructure: CodeQL, SAST, secret scanning in CI/CD
- Development security: pre-commit gates and audit checks
- Dependencies: issues are in dev tooling, not runtime
- Production safety: runtime dependencies are clean
- Local data only: no cloud storage or transmission

Security architecture:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Developer] --> B[Pre-Commit Security Gates]
  B --> C[GitHub Repo]
  C --> D[CI/CD Pipeline: CodeQL, SAST, npm audit]
  D --> E[Production: Hardened Build + Local Data Storage]

    B2[Type Checking]
    B3[Merge Conflict Detection]
    B4[CrisisCore Vulnerability Rules]
  end

  B --> B1 --> B2 --> B3 --> B4
```

Mitigation: dependency updates are in progress; the security framework
ensures dev-tooling issues don't affect production builds.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dynamic badges and metrics

Badges (tests, coverage, security, LOC, issues, PRs, commit activity)
are generated by scripts under scripts/ and served as JSON in badges/
for Shields.io.

Sources:

- scripts/generate-test-badge.mjs
- scripts/generate-coverage-badge.mjs
- scripts/generate-security-badge.mjs
- scripts/generate-loc-badge.mjs
- scripts/generate-bundle-badge.mjs

Local refresh (PowerShell):

```powershell
npm run badge:all
```

Or individually:

```powershell
npm run badge:tests
npm run badge:loc
node scripts/generate-security-badge.mjs
```

The pre-push hook (.husky/pre-push) auto-regenerates and commits badge
JSONs when pushing main to keep them current and reduce noise.

Color thresholds:

- Coverage: 90+ brightgreen, 80‚Äì89 green, 70‚Äì79 yellowgreen,
  60‚Äì69 yellow, 50‚Äì59 orange, <50 red
- Tests: scaled to project size (adjust as the suite grows)
- LOC: favors smaller core; green under 1k, yellowgreen <5k,
  yellow <12k, orange <20k, red beyond

Mutation badge is updated weekly; local runs show n/a until a report exists.

## üö® Why Pain Tracker Exists

Pain is more than a number. Most apps oversimplify‚Äîthis one doesn't. We built **Pain Tracker** to **map pain in high resolution** for real-world recovery, backed by **WorkSafe BC reporting** and **security-focused engineering**.
>>>>>>> d73cc0d (test: Fix async error assertion)

Standard pain apps often reduce complex experiences to a single number. This project is different. We built **Pain Tracker** to **map pain in high resolution**, providing the detailed insights needed for real-world recovery, **WorkSafe BC reporting**, and effective clinical collaboration.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status**: This project is in **early development** (v0.1.0-dev). The core feature set is functional, tested, and secure. We are now actively resolving vulnerabilities in development dependencies. See the [Security Status](#-security-status) for more details.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Status

**Current Security Posture**: CrisisCore Systems has implemented comprehensive security infrastructure, but the project currently has dependency vulnerabilities that require attention:

- ‚úÖ **Security Infrastructure**: Complete CI/CD security pipeline with CodeQL, SAST, and secret scanning
- ‚úÖ **Development Security**: Pre-commit hooks, vulnerability scanning, and security-focused code practices  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Dependencies**: 77 vulnerabilities in dev dependencies (73 critical, 1 high, 3 moderate)
- ‚úÖ **Production Safety**: Vulnerabilities are in development tools, not runtime dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Local Data Only**: No cloud storage or data transmission reduces attack surface

**Security Architecture**:
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Developer] --> B[Pre-Commit Security Gates]
  B --> C[GitHub Repo]
  C --> D[CI/CD Pipeline: CodeQL, SAST, npm audit]
  D --> E[Production: Hardened Build + Local Data Storage]

    B2[Type Checking]
    B3[Merge Conflict Detection]
    B4[CrisisCore Vulnerability Rules]
  end

  B --> B1 --> B2 --> B3 --> B4
```

**Mitigation Plan**: Dependency updates are in progress. The security framework ensures that vulnerabilities in development tools don't affect the production application.

| Layer | Tech Stack |
|-------|------------|
| **Frontend** | React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Headless UI |

## üõ†Ô∏è Dynamic Badges & Metrics

The badges at the top (tests, coverage %, security vulns, LOC, issues, PRs, commit activity) are generated via scripts in `scripts/` and JSON endpoints in `badges/` consumed by Shields.io.

Generation sources:
- `scripts/generate-test-badge.mjs`: counts tests via Vitest list / fallback static scan.
- `scripts/generate-coverage-badge.mjs`: reads `coverage/coverage-summary.json` (v8) after `vitest` run.
- `scripts/generate-security-badge.mjs`: parses `security-audit-report.json`.
- `scripts/generate-loc-badge.mjs`: fast LOC count over `.ts/.tsx` excluding vendor/output.
- `scripts/generate-bundle-badge.mjs`: parses esbuild metafile (or fallback) to compute total JS+CSS size.

Local refresh (PowerShell):

```powershell
npm run badge:all
```

Or individually:

```powershell
npm run badge:tests
npm run badge:loc
node scripts/generate-security-badge.mjs
```

Git pre-push hook (`.husky/pre-push`) auto-regenerates and amends/commits badge JSONs when pushing `main` to keep them current and reduce noisy commits.

Color thresholds:
- Coverage: 90+ brightgreen, 80‚Äì89 green, 70‚Äì79 yellowgreen, 60‚Äì69 yellow, 50‚Äì59 orange, <50 red.
- Tests count: scaled for current project size (>=250 brightgreen ... <60 lightgrey) ‚Äì adjust as suite grows.
- LOC: Favor smaller core; green under 1k, yellowgreen <5k, yellow <12k, orange <20k, red beyond.

Future ideas: bundle size badge (real metafile integration pending), mutation score, performance timing snapshots.

### DevOps & Security Tooling

- **DevOps**: GitHub Actions, Husky, CommitLint, Makefile workflows
- **Security**: CodeQL, npm audit, CrisisCore Gates, CSP headers

Mutation badge is updated via a weekly workflow; local runs will show "n/a" until a report exists.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Status

<<<<<<< HEAD
Security is a core principle, not an afterthought. We've implemented a comprehensive, multi-layered security strategy.

- ‚úÖ **Complete CI/CD Pipeline**: Integrated CodeQL, SAST, secret scanning, and dependency audits.
- ‚úÖ **Hardened Development**: Pre-commit hooks enforce security rules before code ever reaches the repository.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: We are actively remediating 77 vulnerabilities found in **development dependencies**.
- ‚úÖ **Production Safety**: These vulnerabilities are confined to our dev tooling and **do not affect the production build** or runtime environment.
- ‚úÖ **Zero Attack Surface**: With all data stored locally, the application has no cloud footprint to attack.
