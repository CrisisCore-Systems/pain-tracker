## üö® The Mission

Standard pain apps often reduce complex experiences to a single number. This project is different. We built **Pain Tracker** to **map pain in high resolution**, providing the detailed insights needed for real-world recovery, **WorkSafe BC reporting**, and effective clinical collaboration.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status**: This project is in **early development** (v0.1.0-dev). The core feature set is functional, tested, and secure. We are now actively resolving vulnerabilities in development dependencies. See the [Security Status](#-security-status) for more details.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Status

Security is a core principle, not an afterthought. We've implemented a comprehensive, multi-layered security strategy.

- ‚úÖ **Complete CI/CD Pipeline**: Integrated CodeQL, SAST, secret scanning, and dependency audits.
- ‚úÖ **Hardened Development**: Pre-commit hooks enforce security rules before code ever reaches the repository.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: We are actively remediating 77 vulnerabilities found in **development dependencies**.
- ‚úÖ **Production Safety**: These vulnerabilities are confined to our dev tooling and **do not affect the production build** or runtime environment.
- ‚úÖ **Zero Attack Surface**: With all data stored locally, the application has no cloud footprint to attack.
