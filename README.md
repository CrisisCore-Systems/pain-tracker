## 🚀 Getting Started

-### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js 20 (LTS) is the standardized version for development and CI. Older LTS versions (18) may work, but CI and workflows are aligned to Node 20.
-
- Note: an `.nvmrc` file has been added to the repository to pin the Node.js version for local development.
 - npm 9+
 - Modern browser with IndexedDB support

### Canvas on Windows

If you are developing on Windows or running CI on Windows runners, follow the detailed instructions in `docs/CANVAS_WINDOWS_PREREQS.md` to install Visual Studio Build Tools or MSYS2 and the native `cairo` dependencies required by `canvas@3.x`.

### Badges
Badges (tests, coverage, security, LOC, issues, PRs, commit activity) are generated
by scripts in `scripts/` and stored under `badges/` for Shields.io.

Local refresh (PowerShell):

```powershell
npm run badge:all
```

Or individually:

```powershell
npm run badge:tests
npm run badge:loc
node scripts/generate-security-badge.mjs
```

The pre-push hook (`.husky/pre-push`) auto-regenerates and commits badge JSONs when
pushing `main` to keep them current.

Color thresholds:

- Coverage: 90+ `brightgreen`, 80–89 `green`, 70–79 `yellowgreen`,
  60–69 `yellow`, 50–59 `orange`, <50 `red`
- LOC thresholds favor smaller core (adjust as needed)

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CrisisCore-Systems/pain-tracker.git
cd pain-tracker

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run comprehensive tests
npm run test:coverage
```

### Contributor setup (quick)

Follow these lightweight steps when contributing or onboarding locally.

- Keep dependencies healthy:
  - Run an audit regularly: `npm audit`.
  - Attempt safe auto-fixes: `npm audit fix` (non-forcing). If nothing remains, you're good; if transitive/dev-only issues persist, update the direct dev dependency (for example `@stryker-mutator/core`) and re-run the audit.

- Database developer helpers (safe placeholders):
  - Dry-run (recommended):
    - `npm run db:migrate` — shows migration command recommendations
    - `npm run db:reset` — shows reset recommendations
    - `npm run db:seed`  — shows seeding recommendations
  - Execute (only on local/test DB and after reviewing):
    - `DRY_RUN=false npm run db:migrate`
    - `DRY_RUN=false npm run db:reset`
    - `DRY_RUN=false npm run db:seed`

- Runtime validation helpers:
  - Lightweight helpers are in `src/utils/validation.ts`:
    - `assertNumericRange(value, name, min, max)` — runtime numeric guard
    - `sanitizeNote(note, maxLength?)` — reduces accidental long-digit PHI and truncates
  - Tests for the helpers live in `src/utils/__tests__/validation.test.ts`.

- Running tests locally:
  - Single file: `npm run test -- path/to/testfile`
  - All tests: `npm run test` or `npm run test:coverage` for coverage

Notes:
- The database scripts are intentionally non-destructive by default (DRY_RUN mode). Only disable DRY_RUN when you're certain you're pointing at a local/test database.
- Dev-only vulnerabilities are lower priority than production ones, but we recommend fixing them before releases. Avoid `npm audit fix --force` unless you run the full test suite and review changes.


### Production Build

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Pre-deployment validation (recommended before deploying)
npm run deploy:precheck

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

For comprehensive deployment instructions, see:
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Pre-deployment checklist

## 🧪 **Testing & Quality**

### **Testing Strategy**
- **Unit Tests**: Component and utility function testing
- **Integration Tests**: Store and service interaction testing  
- **Mutation Testing**: Code quality and test effectiveness analysis
- **Security Testing**: Automated vulnerability and penetration testing

### **Quality Metrics**
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Generate security audit
npm run security-full

# Update project metrics
npm run badge:all

# Health check
npm run doctor
```
