> **A security-first, offline-capable chronic pain tracking application built with empathy and clinical-minded design.**

Pain Tracker provides high-resolution, multidimensional pain tracking with a security-first, local-first architecture. It includes clinician-focused exports and WorkSafeBC-oriented reporting utilities.

Some integrations (for example weather correlation, clinic auth, and payments) rely on network calls and must be explicitly configured/enabled; see the implementation snapshot in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for current status.

*The Pain Tracker dashboard featuring the 7-step pain assessment form, customizable widgets, analytics visualizations, and trauma-informed design.*

---

## 🎯 **Vision & Mission**

**Vision:** Transform chronic pain management through technology that respects patient privacy while delivering clinically useful insights.

**Mission:** Bridge the gap between patient experience and clinical understanding through secure, accessible, and clinically useful pain tracking.

---

## 📖 **Origin Story**

> *"I wrote software from motel rooms while homeless. Checking if CI passed while warming hands over a fire behind a gas station."*

Pain Tracker wasn't built in a comfortable office. It was built through housing instability, medical trauma, and systems that failed when they should have helped. Every architectural decision—offline-first, local-first-by-default storage, trauma-informed UI—comes from lived experience.

When your data has been used against you, you build software that minimizes unnecessary exposure. Not by policy alone—by architecture and defaults.

## 🔒 **Privacy-First Architecture**

Pain Tracker is designed with **your privacy as the foundation**, not an afterthought. The default workflow is local-first with user-controlled exports.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/diagrams/architectural-data-flow.svg" alt="Architectural Data Flow" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
</p>

### How Your Data Stays Private

**Your Device → Local Encryption → User-Controlled Export → Your Explicit Choice**

1. **📱 Your Device with Shield**: By default, your entries are stored on your device; sharing happens through explicit export/import flows
2. **🔐 Local Encryption Layer**: AES-GCM helpers for encrypting sensitive data stored locally (IndexedDB)
3. **📤 User-Controlled Export**: Manual exports (WorkSafeBC-oriented reports, PDF clinical reports, CSV/JSON downloads)
4. **🤝 Your Explicit Choice**: YOU decide when and where to share - with your doctor, WorkSafe BC, or keep it private locally

**Note on integrations**: Some optional features require network calls (for example weather correlation, payments, or clinic workflows). These require configuration and should be treated as separate trust boundaries.

<summary><strong>📊 See Additional Privacy Architecture Diagrams</strong></summary>

**Vertical Privacy Flow:**
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/diagrams/privacy-first-flow.svg" alt="Privacy-First Data Flow" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
</p>

**Side-by-Side Comparison:**
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/diagrams/data-flow-comparison.svg" alt="Data Flow Comparison" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
</p>

**The Difference (high level):**
- **Many traditional apps**: Use accounts and server-side storage by default
- **Pain Tracker (default workflow)**: Local-first storage with user-controlled export/sharing

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**

- **Node.js 20 (LTS)**: Standardized version for development and CI. An `.nvmrc` file is included to pin the version for local development.
- **npm 9+**: Package manager required.
- **Modern browser**: Must support IndexedDB for local storage.

> **Note**: Older LTS versions (18) may work, but CI and workflows are aligned to Node 20.

### Canvas on Windows

If you are developing on Windows or running CI on Windows runners, follow the detailed instructions in `docs/ops/CANVAS_WINDOWS_PREREQS.md` to install Visual Studio Build Tools or MSYS2 and the native `cairo` dependencies required by `canvas@3.x`.

### Badges
Badges (tests, coverage, security, LOC, issues, PRs, commit activity) are generated
by scripts in `scripts/` and stored under `badges/` for Shields.io.

Local refresh (PowerShell):

```powershell
npm run badge:all
```

Or individually:

```powershell
npm run badge:tests
npm run badge:loc
node scripts/generate-security-badge.mjs
```

The pre-push hook (`.husky/pre-push`) auto-regenerates badge JSONs when pushing
`main` to keep them current.

Note: the pre-push hook intentionally **never** creates commits. If badge JSONs
change, the hook will block the push and ask you to commit the updated badge
files explicitly.

Color thresholds:

- Coverage: 90+ `brightgreen`, 80–89 `green`, 70–79 `yellowgreen`,
  60–69 `yellow`, 50–59 `orange`, <50 `red`
- LOC thresholds favor smaller core (adjust as needed)

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CrisisCore-Systems/pain-tracker.git
cd pain-tracker

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run comprehensive tests
npm run test:coverage
```

### Contributor setup (quick)

Follow these lightweight steps when contributing or onboarding locally.

- Keep dependencies healthy:
  - Run an audit regularly: `npm audit`.
  - Attempt safe auto-fixes: `npm audit fix` (non-forcing). If nothing remains, you're good; if transitive/dev-only issues persist, update the direct dev dependency (for example `@stryker-mutator/core`) and re-run the audit.

- Database developer helpers (safe placeholders):
  - Dry-run (recommended):
    - `npm run db:migrate` — shows migration command recommendations
    - `npm run db:reset` — shows reset recommendations
    - `npm run db:seed`  — shows seeding recommendations
  - Execute (only on local/test DB and after reviewing):
    - `DRY_RUN=false npm run db:migrate`
    - `DRY_RUN=false npm run db:reset`
    - `DRY_RUN=false npm run db:seed`

- Runtime validation helpers:
  - Lightweight helpers are in `src/utils/validation.ts`:
    - `assertNumericRange(value, name, min, max)` — runtime numeric guard
    - `sanitizeNote(note, maxLength?)` — reduces accidental long-digit PHI and truncates
  - Tests for the helpers live in `src/utils/__tests__/validation.test.ts`.

- Running tests locally:
  - Single file: `npm run test -- path/to/testfile`
  - All tests: `npm run test` or `npm run test:coverage` for coverage

Notes:
- The database scripts are intentionally non-destructive by default (DRY_RUN mode). Only disable DRY_RUN when you're certain you're pointing at a local/test database.
- Dev-only vulnerabilities are lower priority than production ones, but we recommend fixing them before releases. Avoid `npm audit fix --force` unless you run the full test suite and review changes.


### Production Build

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Pre-deployment validation (recommended before deploying)
npm run deploy:precheck

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

### Deployment Options

**Option 1: GitHub Pages** (Default - Static hosting)

```bash
npm run deploy
```
