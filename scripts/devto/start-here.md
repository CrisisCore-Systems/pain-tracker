# Start Here: PainTracker + CrisisCore Build Log (Privacy-First, Offline-First, No Surveillance)

PainTracker is a privacy-first, offline-first pain tracker built for the moments that matter.
No cloud dependency. No surveillance business model. Client-side encryption where it counts.
These posts share the foundations (why) and the build log (how) behind CrisisCore systems.
If you’re living with chronic pain, you deserve tools that don’t trade your safety for “engagement.”
If you’re building healthcare software, you deserve patterns that survive crisis conditions.

## Two tracks (pick what you need)

- **Foundations**: local-first architecture and trust boundaries (offline behavior, storage, validation, exports)
- **Build log**: crisis-mode UX, testing, and performance under pressure
