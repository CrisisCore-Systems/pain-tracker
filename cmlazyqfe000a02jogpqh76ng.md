## What to look for in a pain tracking app

Choosing a pain tracking app involves balancing several competing priorities: clinical utility, privacy protection, ease of use, offline capability, and long-term data ownership. Most apps excel at one or two of these while neglecting the others. Understanding your own priorities—whether privacy is non-negotiable, whether you need offline access, whether clinical export formats matter—helps narrow the field.

The most important question to ask any pain app is: where does my data go? Cloud-based apps store your health data on remote servers. Local-only apps keep everything on your device. Hybrid apps may store locally but sync or back up to the cloud. Each model carries different privacy implications that should inform your choice.

## Common features across pain tracking apps

Most pain tracking apps offer core features: a numerical pain scale (usually 0–10), body location mapping, symptom quality descriptors, medication logging, and some form of trend visualisation. The differences lie in implementation quality—how quickly you can complete an entry, how clinically useful the exports are, and how well the app handles edge cases like flare days when your capacity is minimal.

More advanced features include weather correlation, mood tracking, sleep integration, clinical-grade export formats, and pattern analysis. PainTracker provides all of these while maintaining local-only data storage—a combination that most competitors do not offer.

## Privacy as a differentiator

Privacy is where pain tracking apps diverge most significantly. Many popular apps collect analytics, require account creation, and store data on company servers. Some share data with third parties for research or advertising purposes—practices that may be disclosed in lengthy terms of service but are rarely highlighted to users.

PainTracker is built on a zero-knowledge architecture: no accounts, no servers receiving health data, no analytics collecting personal information, and no third-party SDKs with access to your entries. This approach is architecturally different from adding a "privacy mode" to a cloud app—when there is no server-side data store, there is nothing to breach, subpoena, or monetise.

## Offline capability comparison

True offline capability means every feature works without an internet connection—not just data entry, but analytics, exports, and visualisations. Many apps that claim offline support actually require connectivity for key features or periodically sync data to servers in the background.

PainTracker is a Progressive Web App that functions entirely offline after installation. Entry logging, trend analysis, pattern recognition, and PDF/CSV/JSON export all run locally in your browser. This is not a degraded offline mode—it is the app's primary operating mode. Internet connectivity is only needed for the initial installation and subsequent code updates.

## Clinical utility and export quality

An app's clinical value is largely determined by its export quality. Can you produce a report that a doctor will actually read and use? Apps that export only raw data or app-specific formats create extra work for clinicians. PainTracker's PDF exports follow clinical documentation conventions, with summary statistics, trend charts, and structured entries formatted for professional medical contexts.

WorkSafeBC-specific templates, medication response summaries, and functional impact reports set PainTracker apart for Canadian patients navigating healthcare and insurance systems. The exports are designed by studying what clinicians and claims reviewers actually need, not what looks good in a marketing screenshot.
