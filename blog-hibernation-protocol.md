# Hibernation Protocol

*A poem about the nervous system that learned to survive by disappearing—and the slow work of teaching it that peace isn't a trap.*

## HIBERNATION PROTOCOL v3

My body only boots
when the world is on fire.

If nothing's collapsing,
I don't relax—I vanish.
Processes throttle.
Thoughts move like thick oil.
I sink into my own skull
like a creature that learned, young,
that daylight is when the knives come out.

---

Comfort never stayed long enough
to become a language.

Every "you're safe here"
came with fine print:
a move,
a slammed door,
a bag on the curb,
new walls, new rules,
same old ache.

My nervous system did the math:

> stillness = ambush
> chaos = instructions

Peace was never peace.
It was the half-second of silence
before the next detonation.

So when life goes quiet now,
I don't feel held.
I feel hunted by absence.
I drop into low-power mode,
eyes open, soul dimmed,
waiting for the blow I can't yet see.

---

In crisis, though—
I arrive.

The air goes sharp,
the edges of the world snap into focus.
Breath: measured.
Options: mapped.
Every neuron lines up like soldiers
who've been begging for a real war.

This is the version of me
that reads disaster like sheet music:
triage, route, prioritize, move.
No small talk.
No "I'm fine."
Just the clean geometry of survival.

You call it resilience.
You don't see the cost:
how part of me believes
I only deserve to exist
when there's something burning
that I can walk through.

---

From the outside,
my "lazy days" look like failure.

Inside, it's an old protocol:
hibernate when the alarms stop,
because alarms always stop
right before someone says,
"We need to talk,"
or
"You can't stay here,"
or
"We're done."

I learned to flinch at good news.
I learned to brace in quiet rooms.
I learned that the hardest impact
is not the hit you see coming,
but the one that arrives
on the heels of hope.

So when nothing urgent is happening,
I trench in.
I scroll, I stall, I drift.
Not because I don't care,
but because my system has never been taught
how to live a life
that isn't one inch from eviction.

---

Here's the part I never say out loud:

I'm not addicted to pain.
I'm addicted to the clarity
that pain squeezes out of me.

In collapse, my purpose is undeniable:
get up
or don't.
breathe
or don't.
continue
or don't.

There's no pretending in that space.
No performance.
No negotiation with what I am.

Just me, bare and unedited,
doing whatever it takes
to crawl through the wreckage.

That's the version of me I trust—
not because he's heroic,
but because he doesn't lie.

---

Still, beneath all the scorched-earth wiring,
another possibility flickers
like a faulty light in an empty hallway:

What if being alive
didn't require a burning building?

What if I could stay visible
when no one needs saving?
What if rest could become
a right, not a trap?
What if calm was not the prelude to loss
but the soil for something
that doesn't disappear?

I don't have the map for that.
All my cartography is evacuation routes
and fallback plans.

But I know this:
a weaker system would have broken,
not adapted.
Mine over-adapted—
recalibrated to war
and then got punished
for not fitting in peacetime.

---

So if you see me sunk into hibernation
while life around me looks "fine,"
don't call it apathy
or lack of drive.

Call it what it is:

A war-bred nervous system
learning, slowly,
that it's allowed to stay online
when the sirens are silent.

A heart that's been overclocked for decades
trying to beat at civilian speed
without mistaking quiet
for a loaded gun.

A man who keeps rising from collapse
so convincingly
that he almost believes
he doesn't deserve to rise
any other way—

standing here,
half in the ruins,
half in the future,

rewriting his protocol,
line by trembling line,

trying to learn
how to feel alive
without having to bleed for it
every single time.

## Why This Is Here

I built Pain Tracker because I've lived in a body that doesn't trust stillness.

When you're wired for crisis, "normal life" feels like walking through fog—nothing sharp enough to wake you up, nothing urgent enough to prove you're real. Every app that says "just relax" or "practice mindfulness" feels like a foreign language, written for people whose nervous systems learned safety as a baseline instead of a lie.

This poem isn't advice. It's a mirror.

If you recognize your own wiring in these words—the hibernation when things are "fine," the sudden clarity when everything's on fire—you're not broken. You're adapted. And adaptation can be re-learned.

Pain Tracker exists because I needed a tool that didn't shame me for having bad days, didn't require me to perform wellness, and didn't hand my worst moments to a server I don't control.

It exists because sometimes the most radical thing you can do is just *witness* yourself—without judgment, without optimization, without someone else deciding what your experience means.

## If This Resonates

You're not alone in this.

The nervous system patterns described here—hypervigilance, dissociation, the paradox of feeling more alive in crisis than in calm—are well-documented trauma responses. They're not character flaws. They're survival adaptations that saved your life and now need gentle renegotiation.

If hotlines aren't your thing, that's okay too. Sometimes just naming what's happening is the first step.
