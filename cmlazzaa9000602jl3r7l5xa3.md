## What physiotherapists need from pain data

Physiotherapists assess treatment effectiveness through functional outcomes—what you can do, how much, and how pain responds to activity. A pain log that captures only intensity misses the functional context that PTs rely on. Recording what activities you attempted, how your pain responded, and whether prescribed exercises helped or worsened symptoms gives your physiotherapist the data they need to adjust your treatment plan.

PTs also use between-session data to monitor compliance with home exercise programs. If your physiotherapist prescribed daily stretches and your log shows consistent tracking alongside those exercises, it demonstrates engagement and provides objective data about whether the program is working.

## Tracking exercise response

Record your pain levels before and after prescribed exercises. Note which exercises you completed, any modifications you made, and whether specific movements consistently worsen or improve symptoms. This exercise-response data is extraordinarily valuable for PTs: it shows not just whether you are doing the exercises, but how your body responds to them.

PainTracker's notes and tags fields let you annotate entries with exercise details. Over several sessions, patterns emerge: certain exercises may consistently reduce pain, while others may need modification. This data helps your PT fine-tune your program without waiting for you to recall details during an appointment.

## Functional impact documentation

Document what you could and could not do each day. How long could you sit before pain increased? Could you lift, carry, or reach without aggravation? Did pain affect your sleep, driving, or household tasks? This functional data is what physiotherapists use to assess whether treatment is producing real-world improvements.

Functional progress may be invisible to intensity scores alone. You might rate your pain as the same 5 out of 10, but now you can sit for two hours instead of thirty minutes. Recording both intensity and function captures the full picture of your recovery trajectory.

## Preparing your export for PT appointments

Before your physiotherapy appointment, export a report covering the period since your last visit. PainTracker's PDF export provides the summary statistics and trend charts that give your PT an instant overview. Highlight any changes in pain patterns, functional improvements or declines, and your response to prescribed exercises.

Bring the report printed or on your phone. Start the session by handing it to your physiotherapist with a brief verbal summary: "Pain has decreased on average since we started the new exercises, but I am still getting sharp pain in the left shoulder when I reach overhead." This combination of structured data and specific verbal context makes the appointment more productive.

## Long-term PT outcome tracking

Physiotherapy courses often span weeks to months, and progress can be gradual. Daily tracking creates a continuous record that shows improvement trends even when individual appointments feel similar. Reviewing three months of data might reveal that your average pain has decreased from 6 to 4, your functional capacity has doubled, and flare frequency has halved—improvements that are obvious in data but imperceptible day to day.

This longitudinal evidence is also valuable for insurance claims and workplace return-to-work planning. Documented functional improvement supported by consistent data strengthens the case for ongoing treatment when coverage is reviewed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should I track pain during physiotherapy exercises?

Yes. Recording pain before, during, and after exercises helps your PT assess whether specific movements are therapeutic or aggravating. Use PainTracker's notes field to record exercise-specific observations.

### How do I share my PainTracker data with my physiotherapist?

Export a PDF report covering the period since your last appointment. Print it or show it on your phone at the start of your session. PainTracker's export format is designed for clinical readability.
