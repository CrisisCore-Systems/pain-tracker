## ⚠️ Top 5 Improvement Areas

### 1. Security Dependencies (Medium Priority)
**Issue:** 5 vulnerabilities in dev dependencies
- @vercel/node, js-yaml, esbuild, path-to-regexp, undici
- **Impact:** Development-only, no production risk
- **Fix:** Run `npm audit fix`, evaluate @vercel/node necessity
- **Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

### 2. Bundle Size (Low-Medium Priority)
**Issue:** 1.3 MB main bundle (libsodium-wrappers is 1 MB)
- **Impact:** 3-5s load on 3G networks
- **Fix:** Lazy load crypto libraries, use WebCrypto API alternatives
- **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks

### 3. PWA Testing (Medium Priority)
**Issue:** PWA features exist but need validation
- Service worker present, but cross-browser testing incomplete
- **Impact:** Uncertain iOS/Android behavior
- **Fix:** Playwright PWA tests, real device testing
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

### 4. Validation Integration (Medium Priority)
**Issue:** Validation components ready but not integrated
- Behind REACT_APP_ENABLE_VALIDATION feature flag
- **Impact:** Suboptimal data quality
- **Fix:** Complete form integration, enable by default
- **Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

### 5. Advanced Visualizations (Low Priority)
**Issue:** Temporal body heatmaps incomplete
- Basic visualizations working, advanced features in progress
- **Impact:** Nice-to-have, not blocking
- **Fix:** Complete temporal progression, correlation graphs
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks
