## Why migraine tracking is essential

Migraine management relies heavily on pattern recognition. Attack frequency, duration, severity, associated symptoms, and treatment response are all data points that guide clinical decisions about preventive medications, acute treatments, and lifestyle modifications. Without consistent tracking, both you and your neurologist are making decisions based on incomplete and potentially inaccurate recall.

A migraine diary also provides critical evidence for diagnosis. The International Classification of Headache Disorders uses attack frequency, duration, and symptom characteristics to distinguish migraine subtypes and differentiate migraine from other headache disorders. Structured tracking data supports accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

## What to track for migraine management

For each migraine attack, record: onset time, pain intensity at peak, pain location (unilateral vs bilateral, specific areas), associated symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, aura), duration until resolution, and acute medications taken with their timing and effectiveness. PainTracker's structured inputs capture all of these through taps and selections rather than free-text entry.

Between attacks, track potential triggers: sleep patterns, dietary factors, weather changes, hormonal timing, stress levels, and physical activity. Consistent inter-attack tracking is what reveals trigger patterns—information that is nearly impossible to identify retrospectively. A month of daily tracking typically reveals two or three triggers that you can then systematically test and manage.

## Monitoring medication effectiveness

Preventive migraine medications can take weeks or months to show full effect, and subtle changes in attack frequency or severity may be imperceptible without tracking data. A structured diary that records attacks alongside medication history provides the objective before-and-after comparison that you and your prescriber need to assess whether a treatment is working.

Acute medication tracking is equally important. Recording what you took, when you took it relative to attack onset, and how effectively it relieved symptoms helps optimise your acute treatment strategy. Many patients discover through tracking that they are consistently medicating too late for optimal effectiveness—a pattern that is easy to correct once identified.

## Recognising warning signs and patterns

Many migraineurs experience prodromal symptoms—mood changes, food cravings, neck stiffness, yawning—hours or days before an attack. Tracking these pre-attack symptoms alongside attacks can help you recognise warning signs earlier, potentially allowing pre-emptive treatment or activity modification.

Seasonal patterns, menstrual cycle correlations, and weather-related triggers also emerge from longitudinal tracking. PainTracker's local analytics can highlight these temporal patterns without sending your sensitive health data to any server—an important consideration when tracking involves hormonal and mental health data.

## Sharing migraine data with your neurologist

Neurologists managing migraine patients want concise, structured data: attack frequency per month, average severity, medication use patterns, and any changes in headache characteristics. PainTracker's PDF export provides this clinical summary along with trend charts that show attack patterns over time.

If you are being evaluated for chronic migraine (fifteen or more headache days per month), a detailed diary is not just helpful—it is diagnostically necessary. Three months of consistent tracking provides the evidence your neurologist needs to confirm diagnosis, justify treatment changes, or support referrals to headache specialty centres.
