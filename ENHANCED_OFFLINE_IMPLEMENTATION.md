## Usage Examples

### Basic Setup
```typescript
import { advancedOfflineManager } from './lib/advanced-offline';

// Initialize and download essential resources
await advancedOfflineManager.resourceManager.downloadEssentialResources();
await advancedOfflineManager.insightsProcessor.processNewInsights();
```

### Conflict Resolution
```typescript
// Automatic conflict handling during sync
const resolvedData = await advancedOfflineManager.handleDataSync(
  localPainEntry, 
  remotePainEntry, 
  'pain-entry'
);

// Manual conflict resolution
const conflicts = advancedOfflineManager.conflictResolver.getUnresolvedConflicts();
const resolved = await advancedOfflineManager.conflictResolver.resolveConflict(
  conflicts[0].id, 
  { type: 'merge' }
);
```

### Offline Resources
```typescript
// Get pain-level appropriate coping strategies
const strategies = advancedOfflineManager.getOfflineCopingStrategies(7, 'back');

// Search available offline content
const resources = advancedOfflineManager.resourceManager.searchOfflineResources(
  'breathing exercise', 
  'coping-strategy'
);
```

### Health Insights
```typescript
// Get generated insights
const insights = advancedOfflineManager.getHealthInsights();
const painPatterns = advancedOfflineManager.insightsProcessor.getLatestInsight('pain-pattern');

// Trigger background processing
await advancedOfflineManager.insightsProcessor.processNewInsights();
```

## Event System

### Custom Events
- `health-insights-updated`: New health insights generated
- `data-conflict-detected`: Data synchronization conflicts detected
- `offline-status-updated`: Offline capabilities status changes

### Event Handling
```typescript
window.addEventListener('health-insights-updated', (event) => {
  const insights = (event as CustomEvent).detail.insights;
  // Update UI with new insights
});

window.addEventListener('data-conflict-detected', (event) => {
  const conflict = (event as CustomEvent).detail;
  // Present conflict resolution interface
});
```
