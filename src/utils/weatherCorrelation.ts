/**
 * Weather Correlation Utilities
 * 
 * Note: pearsonCorrelation and correlatePainWithPressure were removed 
 * as unused dead code on 2025-12-10.
 * 
 * Weather correlation is now handled by:
 * - src/components/analytics/WeatherCorrelationPanel.tsx (UI)
 * - src/services/weather.ts (data fetching)
 * 
 * If statistical correlation functions are needed in the future,
 * consider using a library like 'simple-statistics' instead.
