## How to use
- Update your feature row when ownership, priority, milestone, or estimate changes.
- Link UI placeholders to this file using an anchor or direct reference (e.g. `docs/FEATURE_MATRIX.md#worksafe-bc-export-csvjson`).
- For larger features, link to a companion design doc and include the link in Notes.

## Maintenance
- Owners are responsible for keeping their rows accurate.
- Create a GitHub issue and replace the Notes cell with the issue URL when planning starts.
