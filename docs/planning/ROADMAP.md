## 🎯 Vision

Pain Tracker is a **privacy-first, local-only PWA** for chronic pain management with WorkSafeBC workflows. This roadmap focuses on **enhancing analytics and pattern recognition** while maintaining strict privacy.

## 📊 Current State Assessment

### ✅ What Exists (Verified v1.1.2)
- Modern stack: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- Zustand state management infrastructure
- Component library (Tailwind CSS)

- PWA setup (service workers, manifest)
- Security tooling (encryption workers, CSP config)
- **FHIR R4 Clinical Exports** (Interoperability)
- **Advanced Local Analytics** (Location Heatmaps, Time Patterns)

### ✅ What's Been Verified (Audit Complete)
- Core state management: `pain-tracker-store.ts` with full CRUD operations
- IndexedDB persistence: Custom wrapper in `src/lib/offline-storage.ts`

- WorkSafeBC export: `src/utils/pain-tracker/wcb-export.ts` (implemented; validate)
- Offline-first capabilities: Service worker + IndexedDB sync queue
- **Clinical Integration**: FHIR R4 mapping in `src/services/clinical/FhirMapper.ts`
- **Analytics Service**: Centralized aggregation logic in `src/services/PainAnalyticsService.ts`

### 🚫 What's NOT in v1.1.2

---

## Technical Roadmap (Phases 2-4)

This section defines the active implementation sequence for the next major workstream.
Historical phase labels below are retained for audit history, but execution should follow this order.

### Phase 2: Intelligence

**Goal:** Turn existing analytics into actionable, local-only intelligence.

**Priority deliverables**
- Finalize advanced body heatmaps (region intensity, timeline overlays, trend comparison views).
- Implement machine learning-assisted pain pattern recognition with strict on-device inference only.
- Add predictive analytics for near-term pain episodes with explicit confidence and "insufficient data" states.

**Guardrails**
- No Class A data egress.
- Any ML model must run locally (browser/device), with no remote inference.
- Predictions must be framed as informational support, not diagnosis.

### Phase 3: Integration

**Goal:** Bridge local data sovereignty with clinical utility.

**Priority deliverables**
- Implement bi-directional data sync architecture for clinical workflows (patient-controlled and consent-gated).
- Expand EMR/EHR integration using HL7 FHIR standards (R4 baseline, extensible mapping profiles).
- Harden interoperability validation (resource conformance checks, mapping traceability, error visibility).

**Guardrails**
- All new network surfaces require human review before implementation.
- Consent, auditability, and data minimization are mandatory for every sync pathway.
- Keep local-first behavior as the default operating mode.

### Phase 4: Ecosystem

**Goal:** Scale delivery channels while preserving privacy-first principles.

**Priority deliverables**
- Expand to multi-platform native applications (mobile/desktop) with parity for core safety and accessibility flows.
- Build research-grade anonymization pipelines for optional larger-scale clinical studies.
- Establish governance for de-identification quality, re-identification risk checks, and dataset release controls.

**Guardrails**
- Research export must be opt-in and de-identified by default.
- Platform expansion cannot regress panic mode, accessibility, or offline reliability.
- Any research data workflow touching Class A transformations requires human review.
