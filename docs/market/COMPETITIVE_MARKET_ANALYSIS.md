## 3️⃣ Regulatory Context: WorkSafeBC Reporting

### Reporting Requirements (Forms 6, 7, 8, 11)

| Form | Who Completes | Deadline | Purpose |
|------|---------------|----------|---------|
| **Form 6** | Injured Worker | ASAP | Report injury/disease to employer + WorkSafeBC |
| **Form 7** | Employer | 3 business days | Report work-related injuries to WorkSafeBC |
| **Form 8/11** | Physician | 3 business days | Initial medical report + progress updates |

### Current Pain Points

1. **Manual, paper-based workflows** (fax/mail/PDF upload)
2. **Fragmented data collection** (worker + employer + physician fill separate forms)
3. **No longitudinal tracking** (snapshots only, no trend analysis)
4. **Compliance burden** (tight 3-day deadlines, penalties for late submissions)
5. **Privacy concerns** (photocopied forms, unsecured fax)

### Your Competitive Advantage

- ✅ **Digital-first WorkSafeBC reporting** (auto-populate Forms 6/7/8/11 from pain logs)
- ✅ **Longitudinal data** (export 30/60/90-day trends for claims)
- ✅ **Encrypted, offline-first** (HIPAA-aligned, privacy-first)
- ✅ **Free core for workers** (reduces financial barriers)
- ✅ **Clinical integration** (physicians can access pre-filled Form 8/11 data)
