# Enhanced Offline Capabilities for Pain Tracker PWA

## Overview

The Enhanced Offline Capabilities extend the basic PWA functionality with sophisticated features for advanced offline data management, intelligent conflict resolution, background health insights processing, and comprehensive offline resource access.

## Features

### 1. Advanced Conflict Resolution

#### Intelligent Data Synchronization

- **Automatic Conflict Detection**: Detects conflicts based on timestamps and field-level differences
- **Multiple Resolution Strategies**: Client-wins, server-wins, merge, manual, and latest-timestamp strategies
- **Custom Resolvers**: Domain-specific merge logic for pain entries, settings, and activity logs
- **Conflict Queue**: Manages and tracks conflicts with resolution status

#### Supported Entity Types

- **Pain Entries**: Merges readings, symptoms, and preserves local notes
- **Emergency Contacts**: Prefers client version (user knows best)
- **Settings**: Merges non-conflicting fields, prefers client for preferences
- **Activity Logs**: Uses latest timestamp for resolution

### 2. Sophisticated Data Synchronization

#### Differential Sync

- **Field-Level Comparison**: Only syncs changed fields to minimize bandwidth
- **Intelligent Prioritization**: Critical data syncs first, followed by high/medium/low priority
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed sync operations
- **Batch Operations**: Groups related changes for efficient syncing

#### Sync Strategies

- **Immediate**: Real-time sync for critical changes
- **Scheduled**: Regular background sync intervals
- **Event-Driven**: Sync on specific user actions or connectivity changes
- **Conflict-Aware**: Detects and queues conflicts for resolution

### 3. Offline Resource Management

#### Resource Types

- **Coping Strategies**: Breathing exercises, relaxation techniques, distraction methods
- **Exercise Guides**: Physical therapy routines, stretching exercises
- **Meditation Content**: Guided meditations, mindfulness practices
- **Emergency Contacts**: Healthcare providers, support networks
- **Medication Guides**: Drug information, interaction warnings, dosage guidelines

#### Smart Downloading

- **Priority-Based**: Downloads critical resources first
- **Size Management**: Monitors storage quota and frees space intelligently
- **Context-Aware**: Downloads relevant resources based on user's pain patterns
- **Media Support**: Handles images, audio, and video content

#### Offline Search

- **Full-Text Search**: Search across all offline content
- **Tag-Based Filtering**: Find resources by type, priority, or custom tags
- **Relevance Ranking**: Returns most relevant resources first
- **Pain-Level Matching**: Suggests appropriate strategies based on current pain level

### 4. Background Health Insights Processing

#### Analysis Types

- **Pain Patterns**: Weekly and time-of-day pattern analysis
- **Medication Effectiveness**: Tracks correlation between medications and pain levels
- **Trigger Analysis**: Identifies environmental and behavioral pain triggers
- **Mood Correlations**: Analyzes relationship between mood and pain levels

#### Machine Learning Features

- **Statistical Analysis**: Uses local data for pattern recognition
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides reliability metrics for insights
- **Trend Detection**: Identifies improving, worsening, or stable patterns
- **Recommendation Engine**: Generates actionable health recommendations

#### Background Processing

- **Service Worker Integration**: Runs analysis in background threads
- **Periodic Processing**: Regular insight generation (hourly intervals)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works with limited data, improves with more samples
- **Privacy-First**: All analysis happens locally, no data leaves device

## Technical Implementation

### Core Classes

#### ConflictResolutionService

```typescript
class ConflictResolutionService {
  async detectConflicts(localData: SyncableData, remoteData: SyncableData, entityType: string): Promise<SyncConflict[]>
  async resolveConflict(conflictId: string, strategy?: ConflictResolutionStrategy): Promise<SyncableData>
  getUnresolvedConflicts(): SyncConflict[]
}
```

#### OfflineResourceManager

```typescript
class OfflineResourceManager {
  async downloadResource(resourceId: string, url: string): Promise<boolean>
  async downloadEssentialResources(): Promise<void>
  getOfflineResource(resourceId: string): OfflineResource | null
  searchOfflineResources(query: string, type?: string): OfflineResource[]
  getCopingStrategies(painLevel: number, location?: string): OfflineResource[]
}
```

#### HealthInsightsProcessor

```typescript
class HealthInsightsProcessor {
  async processNewInsights(): Promise<void>
  getInsights(type?: HealthInsight['type']): HealthInsight[]
  getLatestInsight(type: HealthInsight['type']): HealthInsight | null
}
```

### Service Worker Integration

#### Enhanced Background Processing

- **Message-based Communication**: Bidirectional messaging between main thread and service worker
- **Background Sync**: Automatic sync when connection restored
- **Periodic Sync**: Regular insight processing (where supported)
- **Push Notifications**: Alerts for important insights or conflicts

#### Storage Management

- **IndexedDB Integration**: Structured storage for insights and resources
- **Quota Management**: Intelligent storage cleanup and optimization
- **Caching Strategy**: Smart caching for frequently accessed resources
- **Persistence**: Request persistent storage for critical data

## Usage Examples

### Basic Setup

```typescript
import { advancedOfflineManager } from './lib/advanced-offline';

// Initialize enhanced offline capabilities
await advancedOfflineManager.resourceManager.downloadEssentialResources();
await advancedOfflineManager.insightsProcessor.processNewInsights();
```

### Conflict Resolution

```typescript
// Handle data sync with automatic conflict resolution
const resolvedData = await advancedOfflineManager.handleDataSync(
  localPainEntry, 
  remotePainEntry, 
  'pain-entry'
);

// Manual conflict resolution
const conflicts = advancedOfflineManager.conflictResolver.getUnresolvedConflicts();
for (const conflict of conflicts) {
  const resolved = await advancedOfflineManager.conflictResolver.resolveConflict(
    conflict.id, 
    { type: 'merge' }
  );
}
```

### Offline Resources

```typescript
// Get coping strategies for current pain level
const strategies = advancedOfflineManager.getOfflineCopingStrategies(7, 'back');

// Search offline resources
const resources = advancedOfflineManager.resourceManager.searchOfflineResources(
  'breathing exercise', 
  'coping-strategy'
);
```

### Health Insights

```typescript
// Get latest insights
const insights = advancedOfflineManager.getHealthInsights();
const painPatterns = advancedOfflineManager.insightsProcessor.getLatestInsight('pain-pattern');

// Process new insights
await advancedOfflineManager.insightsProcessor.processNewInsights();
```

## Event System

### Custom Events

- **health-insights-updated**: Fired when new insights are generated
- **data-conflict-detected**: Fired when data conflicts are detected
- **offline-status-updated**: Fired when offline capabilities status changes
- **resource-downloaded**: Fired when offline resources are downloaded

### Event Listeners

```typescript
window.addEventListener('health-insights-updated', (event) => {
  const insights = event.detail.insights;
  // Update UI with new insights
});

window.addEventListener('data-conflict-detected', (event) => {
  const conflict = event.detail;
  // Present conflict resolution UI
});
```

## Performance Considerations

### Storage Optimization
