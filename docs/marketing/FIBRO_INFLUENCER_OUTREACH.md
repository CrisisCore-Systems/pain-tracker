**Subject: Fibromyalgia Tracking Tool (ACR 2016-Informed) – Built for the Community**

---

Hi [Name],

I've been following your fibromyalgia advocacy work and deeply appreciate how you validate the lived experiences of our community. Your insights on [specific content they've shared] really resonated.

I wanted to share something we've built specifically for people with fibromyalgia: **Pain Tracker** – a free, open-source health tracking app that actually gets it right.

**Why I think you might be interested:**

🩺 **Clinically Valid, Not Just "Pain Levels"**
- Full ACR 2016 diagnostic criteria implementation (WPI 0-19, SSS 0-12)
- 44+ anatomical locations for mapping widespread pain
- Tracks fibro fog, fatigue, and 19+ symptom qualities (burning, tingling, allodynia, etc.)

💜 **Designed for Chronic Illness Reality**
- Trauma-informed UI for those who've faced medical gaslighting
- Works offline during flares when you can't focus
- Progressive disclosure to reduce cognitive load during fibro fog

🔒 **Your Data Stays Yours**
- Local-first by default – no required cloud account for core tracking
- Built for those of us who've learned to protect our health information
- No data monetization, no corporate access

📋 **Actually Useful for Advocacy**
- Export WorkSafe BC forms (for Canadians with work-related claims)
- Generate appointment summaries for rheumatologists
- Track trigger patterns (weather, stress, activity) with correlation analysis

**The difference:** Most apps treat chronic pain like acute injury. We built this knowing fibromyalgia is a complex biopsychosocial condition. Pattern recognition for flares, pacing tools for energy management, and validation that your symptoms are real and trackable.

**Would you be open to:**
- Taking a look and sharing feedback with the community if it resonates?
- I can provide early access, answer technical questions, or just send the GitHub link

No pressure – I know your time is valuable and you get tons of outreach. Just thought this might genuinely help folks in your community who are tired of apps that don't understand fibromyalgia.

Either way, thank you for the work you do. Medical validation and peer support save lives.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Pain Tracker Team / CrisisCore Systems]

**P.S.** The app is MIT licensed (truly free, no strings attached) and we're actively seeking feedback from the fibro community to keep improving it.

## Alternative: Shorter Version

---

Hi [Name],

Love your fibromyalgia advocacy work, especially [specific recent content].

Quick share: We built an open-source pain tracker with ACR 2016 diagnostic criteria (WPI/SSS), fibro fog tracking, and trauma-informed design. Offline-first, local-first by default – no required cloud account for core tracking.


Key difference: Built for complex chronic illness, not just "rate your pain 1-10." Pattern recognition, flare tracking, energy pacing tools, and WorkSafe BC exports for claims.

Would you be open to checking it out and sharing with your community if it's actually useful? No pressure – just thought it might help folks tired of apps that don't get fibromyalgia.

Thanks for validating our community's experiences.

## Key Talking Points (For Reference)

### What Makes This Different
1. **Clinical Credibility**: ACR 2016 standards, not arbitrary pain scales
2. **Fibro-Specific**: WPI (18 regions), SSS (fatigue/sleep/cognition/somatic), fibro fog tracking
3. **Privacy-First**: Local storage only, no corporate/insurance access to your health data
4. **Trauma-Aware**: Designed for those who've faced medical invalidation
5. **Offline-Capable**: Works during flares without internet stress
6. **Evidence-Based**: Validated assessment tools rheumatologists recognize

### Community Benefits
- **Symptom Validation**: Medical-grade tracking that proves symptoms are real
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify triggers (weather, stress, activity) automatically
- **Advocacy Tool**: Generate professional reports for doctors/disability claims
- **Energy Management**: Pacing tools based on "energy envelope" theory
- **Peer Understanding**: Built by people who understand chronic illness reality

### Trust Signals
- **Open Source**: MIT license, community-driven, no hidden agenda
- **No Monetization**: Not selling your data, no ads, truly free
- **Healthcare Alignment**: WCAG 2.1 AA accessible, HIPAA-aligned practices
- **Active Development**: Transparent roadmap, ML flare prediction planned Q1 2025
- **Community-Informed**: Built with fibromyalgia community input

### Potential Concerns to Address
**"Another health app?"**
→ This one's built on ACR diagnostic criteria, not generic pain tracking. Open source, no corporate ownership.

**"Is my data safe?"**
→ Local-first by default. Your data is stored on-device unless you explicitly export/share it.

**"Will my insurance see this?"**
→ No. Local-only architecture means no one has access unless you explicitly export and share.

**"Too complicated during fibro fog?"**
→ Designed for that. Simplified modes, progressive disclosure, large touch targets, optional gentle language.

**"Does it cost money?"**
→ No. MIT licensed, truly free, no in-app purchases, no premium tiers.

## Customization Notes

**Personalize with:**
1. Specific reference to their recent content (post, video, article)
2. How their advocacy personally helped you/someone you know
3. Any fibromyalgia-specific challenges they've mentioned (weather sensitivity, medical gaslighting, etc.)
4. Their audience size/platform (Instagram vs YouTube vs blog requires different tone)

**Adjust tone for:**
- **Professional advocates**: Lead with clinical credibility (ACR criteria, evidence-based)
- **Peer support leaders**: Lead with trauma-informed design, privacy
- **Medical/research influencers**: Lead with technical implementation, validation
- **Lifestyle/wellness focus**: Lead with energy management, quality of life tracking

**Avoid:**
- Overpromising or sounding like a cure
- Medical advice (we track, doctors diagnose)
- Dismissing other apps (focus on unique value, not comparison)
- Pressure tactics (respect their time and autonomy)

## Follow-Up Strategy

**If they respond positively:**
1. Provide direct links to GitHub, documentation, and live demo
2. Offer to answer technical questions or provide screenshots
3. Ask what their community specifically needs in tracking tools
4. Offer early access to roadmap features (ML prediction, advanced heatmaps)

**If they want to collaborate:**
1. User testing with their community for feedback
2. Featured testimonial (if they genuinely find it useful)
3. Content collaboration (how-to guides, feature explanations)
4. Community-driven feature requests

**If they don't respond:**
1. No follow-up (respect their boundary)
2. Continue building based on community feedback
3. Public documentation is available for anyone who finds it useful

## Ethical Considerations

✅ **Do:**
- Be transparent about capabilities and limitations
- Respect their time and autonomy
- Provide evidence for all claims
- Acknowledge this is a tool, not a treatment
- Center patient/community needs

❌ **Don't:**
- Suggest it replaces medical care
- Overpromise features not yet built
- Pressure for endorsement
- Dismiss their concerns or skepticism
- Use manipulative language or tactics

---

**Remember:** Fibromyalgia influencers get tons of pitches from companies trying to sell to their vulnerable audience. Stand out by being genuinely helpful, transparent, and community-focused.
