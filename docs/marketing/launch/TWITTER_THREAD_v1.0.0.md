🧵👇

**Tweet 2 (The Problem & Privacy)**
Most health apps treat your data as the product. We built differently.

🔒 **Local-First by Default**: Core health entries are stored locally; exports are user-controlled.
🔑 **Client-Side Encryption**: AES-GCM encryption at rest.
🚫 **No Tracking by Default**: No third-party analytics or telemetry enabled by default.

**Tweet 3 (Trauma-Informed Design)**
UX matters when you're in pain.

We use a **Trauma-Informed Design** framework:
✅ No "blame language" or gamification of suffering.
✅ "Panic Mode" for immediate UI simplification.
✅ Built toward a WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility target.

Technology should support you, not overwhelm you.

**Tweet 4 (Clinical Utility)**
Data is only useful if your doctor accepts it.

📋 **Exports**: Generate professional PDF reports oriented around WorkSafeBC workflows (always verify requirements).
📈 **Trend Analysis**: Visualize pain severity, medication efficacy, and environmental factors locally.

Bridge the gap between your experience and clinical understanding.

**Tweet 5 (Resilience)**
Chronic pain doesn't wait for a good Wi-Fi signal.

📱 **Offline-First PWA**: Full functionality without an internet connection.
💾 **Local Storage**: Data is stored in IndexedDB; exports are user-initiated.

Install it on your home screen and use it anywhere.

**Tweet 6 (Open Source)**
Trust is earned through transparency.
