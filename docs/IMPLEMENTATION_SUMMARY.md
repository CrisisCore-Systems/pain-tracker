# Implementation Summary Addendum

This addendum documents the small integration steps added on 2025-09-22 to make validation and encryption features easier to enable for contributors and CI.

- Validation UI integration: `src/components/pain-tracker/PainEntryForm.tsx` now conditionally renders `EmotionalValidation` when `REACT_APP_ENABLE_VALIDATION=true` in the environment. This is read-only and does not change form submission behavior.
- PDF export test: Added `src/test/pdf-generator.test.ts` which exercises `generateWCBReportPDF` with a mocked `jsPDF` to ensure template rendering runs without throwing.
- AES-GCM encrypted IndexedDB shim: `src/lib/storage/encryptedIndexedDB.ts` provides `encryptAndStore` and `retrieveAndDecrypt` helpers. This module is opt-in and requires key provisioning. See `.github/workflows/encryption-check.yml` and `scripts/check-encryption-config.mjs` for CI validation of the encryption key.

Notes for contributors:
- To enable the UI validation panel during local development, set `REACT_APP_ENABLE_VALIDATION=true`.
- To enable CI encryption checks, add a repository secret named `ENCRYPTION_KEY_HEX` (256-bit hex string).
- The encrypted IndexedDB wrapper is intentionally minimal; production key management and rotation are left to the deployment environment.
