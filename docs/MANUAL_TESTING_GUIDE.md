**Steps for Each Browser**:
1. Open app in browser
2. Run Test Cases 1.1-1.4 (PDF export)
3. Run Test Cases 2.1-2.2 (keyboard nav)
4. Note any browser-specific issues

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ PDF export works in all browsers
- ✅ Accessibility features consistent
- ✅ No browser-specific JavaScript errors

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Test Failures (4 of 356 tests)
1. **AdvancedAnalyticsEngine - Large Dataset Test**: Timeout issue, not affecting production
2. **DashboardOverview Test**: Missing mock for PredictiveIndicatorPanel
3. **VaultService Tests (2)**: Timeout issues in test environment

**Impact**: None of these affect the new PDF export or accessibility features.

### Browser Compatibility Notes
- **PDF Generation**: Uses jsPDF library, works in all modern browsers
- **Chart Capture**: Canvas/SVG to PNG conversion, requires modern browser
- **Accessibility**: ARIA features work best in Chrome, Firefox, Safari with modern screen readers

### Performance Considerations
- **Large PDFs**: Generating PDFs with many charts (>50) may take 5-10 seconds
- **Chart Capture**: High-resolution charts increase PDF file size
- **Screen Reader**: Some announcements may be delayed in older screen readers
