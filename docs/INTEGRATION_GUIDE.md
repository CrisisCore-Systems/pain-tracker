## ðŸŽ¨ Step 3: Brand Customization

### Visual Customization

Update your trauma-informed CSS variables to match your brand:

```css
/* Add to your main CSS file */
:root {
  --ti-font-size: 16px;
  --ti-touch-size: 44px;
  --ti-primary-color: #your-brand-color;
  --ti-gentle-color: #soft-green-or-blue;
  --ti-comfort-color: #warm-color;
}

/* Brand-specific trauma-informed classes */
.trauma-informed-container {
  font-family: your-brand-font;
}

.ti-comfort-prompt {
  background: linear-gradient(your-brand-gradient);
  border-color: var(--ti-comfort-color);
}
```

### Message Customization

Customize trauma-informed messages in your components:

```tsx
// Example: Custom comfort prompts
const customComfortPrompts = [
  "You're taking important steps for your health.",
  "Remember to be gentle with yourself today.",
  "Your wellbeing matters - take breaks as needed.",
  // Add your organization's supportive messages
];

// Use in your components
<ComfortPrompt messages={customComfortPrompts} />
```

### Language Customization

Update validation messages to match your organization's tone:

```tsx
const customValidationMessages = {
  required: {
    painLevel: "When you're ready, could you share your current pain level?",
    location: "If comfortable, let us know where you're experiencing pain."
  },
  // Add more custom messages
};
```

## âœ… Step 4: WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance <!-- cspell:disable-line -->

### Automated Compliance Checks

The implementation includes built-in compliance checking:

1. **Color Contrast**: Automatically passes AA standards with high contrast modes
2. **Touch Target Size**: Configurable sizes meet mobile accessibility guidelines
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactive elements
4. **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic markup
5. **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators and logical tab order

### Manual Validation Steps

#### Color Contrast Testing

```bash
# Use browser dev tools or online tools to verify:
# - Normal text: 4.5:1 ratio minimum
# - Large text: 3:1 ratio minimum
# - Interactive elements: 3:1 ratio minimum
```

#### Screen Reader Testing

- Test with NVDA (Windows), JAWS (Windows), or VoiceOver (Mac)
- Verify all content is announced properly
- Check form labels and error messages

#### Keyboard Navigation Testing

- Navigate entire interface using only Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space
- Verify all functionality is accessible via keyboard
- Check focus indicators are clearly visible

### Compliance Documentation

Generate compliance reports using the validation panel:

```tsx
// Add to admin interface
import { TraumaInformedValidationPanel, TraumaInformedTestingChecklist } from './components/accessibility/TraumaInformedValidation';

function ComplianceReport() {
  return (
    <div>
      <TraumaInformedValidationPanel />
      <TraumaInformedTestingChecklist />
    </div>
  );
}
```
