# I Automated WorkSafeBC Forms 6 & 7 So You Don't Have To

*Stop wasting hours on paperwork — generate forms from your entries in a couple of clicks.*

## The Paperwork Problem Every Claimant Faces

If you've filed a WorkSafeBC claim, you know the drill:

* ❌ Hours spent filling Form 6 & 7 by hand
    
* ❌ Trying to remember pain levels from weeks ago
    
* ❌ Stress of potentially missing crucial details
    
* ❌ Anxiety about your private health data in the cloud
    

I watched this destroy my father's recovery after a workplace injury. So I built a better way.

## How Pain Tracker Solves This Permanently

### 🚀 One-Click Form Generation

**Before:** 45+ minutes of manual form filling  
**After:** 2 clicks → PDFs ready to review and submit

### 🔒 Privacy by Design

* Your data is stored locally by default
    
* No cloud storage is required for core tracking
    
* Encrypted storage (implementation details vary by platform/build)
    
* You control your data; the default architecture avoids server-side storage of entries
    

### 💸 Pricing and Availability

Pain Tracker is open source. If you self-host, your primary cost is your own hosting. If you use a hosted build, pricing and terms depend on the deployment.

## Why This Changes Everything for BC Claimants

### For Workers:

* ✅ **Reduce claim processing time** with accurate, consistent data
    
* ✅ **Eliminate paperwork stress** during recovery
    
* ✅ **Protect your privacy** - no data sold or shared
    
* ✅ **Predictable costs** (especially if self-hosting)
    

### The Technical Advantage No Competitor Can Match:

* **Local-first architecture** = better privacy + offline functionality
    
* **WorkSafeBC-specific logic** = forms that actually meet requirements
    
* **Trauma-informed design** = reduces stress during difficult times

## Your Move, BC

If you're dealing with a WorkSafeBC claim, you have two choices:

1. **Continue** the paperwork struggle manually
    
2. **Automate** the process with a tool built specifically for you
    

I built this because BC workers deserve better. Now I need your help to make it even better.
