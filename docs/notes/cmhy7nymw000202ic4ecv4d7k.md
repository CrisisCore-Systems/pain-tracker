# I Automated WorkSafeBC Forms 6 & 7 So You Don't Have To

*Stop Wasting Hours on Paperwork - Get Perfect Forms in 2 Clicks, 100% Free*

## The Paperwork Problem Every Claimant Faces

If you've filed a WorkSafeBC claim, you know the drill:

* ❌ Hours spent filling Form 6 & 7 by hand
    
* ❌ Trying to remember pain levels from weeks ago
    
* ❌ Stress of potentially missing crucial details
    
* ❌ Anxiety about your private health data in the cloud
    

I watched this destroy my father's recovery after a workplace injury. So I built a better way.

## How Pain Tracker Solves This Permanently

### 🚀 One-Click Form Generation

**Before:** 45+ minutes of manual form filling  
**After:** 2 clicks → perfect PDFs ready to submit

### 🔒 Privacy by Design

* Your data **never leaves your device**
    
* **Zero cloud storage** (unlike every competitor)
    
* **AES-256 encryption** at rest
    
* **You own your data** - we can't access it even if we wanted to
    

### 💸 Truly Free Forever

No "freemium" traps. No feature walls. This is our commitment to BC workers.

## Why This Changes Everything for BC Claimants

### For Workers:

* ✅ **Reduce claim processing time** with accurate, consistent data
    
* ✅ **Eliminate paperwork stress** during recovery
    
* ✅ **Protect your privacy** - no data sold or shared
    
* ✅ **Free forever** - no hidden costs
    

### The Technical Advantage No Competitor Can Match:

* **Local-first architecture** = better privacy + offline functionality
    
* **WorkSafeBC-specific logic** = forms that actually meet requirements
    
* **Trauma-informed design** = reduces stress during difficult times
    

## Try It Risk-Free

The app is completely free and requires no sign-up: [**https://crisiscore-systems.github.io/pain-tracker/**](https://crisiscore-systems.github.io/pain-tracker/)

## Your Move, BC

If you're dealing with a WorkSafeBC claim, you have two choices:

1. **Continue** the paperwork struggle manually
    
2. **Automate** the process with a tool built specifically for you
    

I built this because BC workers deserve better. Now I need your help to make it even better.
