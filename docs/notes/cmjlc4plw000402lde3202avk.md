Welcome. If you’ve stumbled onto this blog, you might be a developer interested in offline-first architecture, a chronic pain survivor looking for a tool that doesn’t judge you, or a worker in British Columbia navigating the WorkSafeBC claims process.

Pain Tracker Pro is a **security-first, offline-first, trauma-informed** application designed to help people track chronic pain without surrendering their privacy.

Here is the best way to navigate our content based on who you are.

## 👩‍💻 For Developers & Engineers

We are building a high-performance PWA that challenges the "cloud-default" mindset of modern web development.

* **The Architecture:** Read [The Day I Decided My Pain App Didn't Need a Server](https://blog.paintracker.ca/the-day-i-decided-my-pain-app-didnt-need-a-server-what-i-learned-building-healthcare-software-that-lives-entirely-on-your-device) to understand why we chose a local-first architecture.
    
* **The Tech:** Dive into [Offline-First PWAs: Why They Matter](https://blog.paintracker.ca/offline-first-pwas-why-they-matter-for-crisis-responsive-health-tech) for a deep dive into Service Workers, IndexedDB, and background sync.
    
* **The Ethics:** Check out [Trauma-Informed Design](https://blog.paintracker.ca/building-software-that-actually-gives-a-damn-my-journey-with-trauma-informed-design) to see how we code empathy into the UI.

## 👷 For BC Workers & Claimants

If you are dealing with a workplace injury in British Columbia, this tool was built specifically to help you.

* **The Case Study:** Read [How Pain Tracker Pro Streamlines WorkSafeBC Claims](https://blog.paintracker.ca/how-pain-tracker-pro-streamlines-worksafebc-claims-a-composite-case-study) to see how much time you can save.
    
* **The Solution:** Read [Stop Filling WorkSafeBC Forms Manually](https://blog.paintracker.ca/stop-filling-worksafebc-forms-manually-this-auto-generates-them-for-free) to learn about our export features.

## ❤️ For Everyone Else

This project was born out of personal necessity during a period of homelessness and severe chronic pain.

* **The Origin Story:** [Coding Through Collapse](https://blog.paintracker.ca/coding-through-collapse) explains how this software was built from motel rooms and concrete nooks.
    
* **The Philosophy:** [The Hidden Costs of Health Apps](https://blog.paintracker.ca/the-hidden-costs-of-data-driven-health-apps-what-youre-really-paying-when-healthcare-is-free) explores why privacy matters in healthcare.
