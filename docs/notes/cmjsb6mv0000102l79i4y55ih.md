## The first time I saw the fencing, I did not register it as danger. My brain tried to file it under construction, under temporary, under someone else’s problem.

Orange mesh. Metal feet. The cheap kind of barrier that pretends it is control while quietly admitting it is not. It wrapped around the place like a half-finished thought, tight in some spots, slack in others, until it reached the front and gave up. One section was left open, a gap you can slip through. A courtesy gap. A liability gap. A silent message that felt obvious the longer I stood there.

We are done watching this. You can still leave, though.

I stood there longer than I should have. Cold in my lungs. Key in my hand. Staring at a perimeter that was not about safety. It was about abandonment wearing a reflective vest.

Work stopped. Not paused. Stopped. WorkSafe came down hard and then, like everything else, the weight of it landed on the people still living here.

Nobody works here now. No staff. No maintenance. No familiar footsteps. No one coming tomorrow. Just a property going feral in real time.

And me inside it.

### How a place dies without actually closing

People imagine collapse as something loud. Sirens. Fire. News cameras. A clear order to leave.

The real version is quieter, slower, and honestly more humiliating.

A fridge that fails and never gets replaced.  
A mold spot that keeps coming back.  
A door that does not latch right, so you shoulder-check it every night like your body is the deadbolt.  
A notice posted with the confidence of someone who will not be here when the consequences arrive.

Then the consequences arrive anyway, and you realize you are the only one still living in the building.

The place changes texture. You can feel it. The air turns thin and metallic, like your nervous system knows the official world has stopped caring. That is when the rules change.

It becomes a magnet. Not because the people who drift in are villains, but because desperation looks for shelter. Once the cracks become door-shaped, you start sleeping differently.

Not sleeping like rest. Sleeping like a light coma where one ear stays awake.

I have seen doors kicked in here. Multiple. Not metaphorically. Frames splintered, locks useless, privacy ripped off its hinges and left hanging.

Now every time I walk down the corridor, my brain does threat math in the background like software I never installed but cannot delete.

How many new faces.  
How many footsteps behind me.  
How long would it take to get inside if someone decided my door was optional.  
If I fall asleep hard, will I wake up to the sound of wood breaking.

People say try to relax. Relaxation is a luxury item. I am not being dramatic. I am being accurate.

### The system’s favorite trick

Here is the part that makes me want to break something.

We are past the evidence window.

The claim is already moving forward with its deadlines and careful language, like the world stays still while paperwork happens.

But the world does not stay still. It escalates. It gets worse after the deadline, because of course it does.

It feels like being told you cannot report the fire because you should have predicted the spark two weeks ago.

The process does not have a field for what is actually happening here.

My home turned into a fenced-off hazard zone.  
The building is being abandoned by the people responsible for it.  
There are doors kicked in everywhere and I am scared mine is next.  
This is not a tenancy anymore. It is a pressure cooker.

The system wants clean timelines. Life keeps spilling outside the lines.

So I document anyway. That is what I do when reality is being minimized. I become a witness.

Photos. Notes. Dates. Screenshots. Threads.

Not because I enjoy it, but because if I do not record the truth, the truth gets rewritten by someone with more letterhead than conscience.

And I am tired of losing to paper.

### Fear stops feeling like fear and starts feeling like logistics

It is weird what the body adapts to.

After enough instability, fear stops arriving like a wave and starts living in the walls. It becomes the default setting. The background hum you only notice when it briefly shuts off.

I do not come home anymore. I return to a site.

I do not check the door once. I check it twice. Then I listen.  
I do not lie down like I am safe. I lie down like I am making a tactical decision.

Sometimes I keep my shoes near me like I am camping inside my own room. Sometimes I sleep lighter just to prove I still can.

People talk about housing like it is only about rent. When your shelter becomes unreliable, your mind becomes unreliable too. Not because you are weak, but because it is doing what it evolved to do. Stay alive.

The part that hurts is how invisible that survival is to everyone else. You still show up. You still speak politely. You still answer messages. You still function.

So people assume you are fine.

Meanwhile your nervous system is running a constant emergency drill.

### Sundays are oxygen

Sunday is the day I get to see my son.

I do not have a clean way to explain how much that matters without sounding like I am begging, so I will say it plainly. Sunday is oxygen.

Everything else lately has felt like contraction. Options narrowing. Safety thinning. The future getting smaller and more expensive and harder to reach. Time with him expands something in me that the rest of life keeps trying to crush.

There is always a moment where the storm in my head quiets because he is doing something simple and perfect.

Laughing at something that should not be funny.  
Running ahead like the world is not heavy.  
Getting upset over something tiny and then recovering like it never happened.

In those moments, I remember what normal is supposed to feel like. Not luxury. Just peace without scanning.

Then Sunday ends, and I come back here, and the contrast is brutal. It feels like walking from sunlight into a basement that smells like damp rot and unkept promises.

The switch is not just emotional. It is physical. My chest tightens. My stomach drops. My mind starts counting risks again.

I hate that this is the shape of my life right now. One day of meaning, six days of survival.

But I refuse to let that one day die.

### Building software in a collapsing room

This part sounds insane until you have lived this kind of life.

I have been building through it.

When the physical world becomes unstable, I build systems that behave. When people vanish, I make something that does not.

I have been pouring myself into PainTracker because code is one of the only places left where cause and effect still make sense.

You write a feature and it exists.  
You run a test and it tells you the truth.  
You refactor a mess and the mess becomes smaller.

No landlord can forget to fix it. No bureaucracy can deny it happened. No one can gaslight a passing test.

Recently I implemented voice commands. Real voice commands, not just dictation. Full action execution. Natural language parsing. Hook integration. It is the kind of feature that feels small until you remember what pain and stress do to a person.

They steal your hands.  
They steal your focus.  
They steal your ability to do simple things without friction.

So giving someone the ability to speak and have the system respond is not just cool UX. It is dignity. It is access. It is a little less effort required to exist.

Some nights I am working with my phone almost dead, battery anxiety chewing at the edges of my thoughts. Some nights I am writing code in a room where I am not fully sure my door will hold.

That is not a motivational poster. That is a fact.

And the fact changes you.

Because when you build under pressure long enough, you start seeing the world as interfaces and failure points. You start noticing where things break. You start noticing who disappears when responsibility arrives.

You start noticing patterns.

### The truth under the anger

I have been angry. Not grumpy. Not in a mood. Angry like a person watching the same negligence wear different masks.

Angry because the people responsible can step away and call it a situation, while I have to sleep inside the consequences.  
Angry because the process wants neatness while my reality is getting worse.  
Angry because people seem comfortable letting things rot as long as the rot stays out of their inbox.

Under the anger is exhaustion that sleep does not touch.

Not the tiredness of working hard. The tiredness of bracing.

Bracing takes more energy than labor, because bracing never ends.

Your brain does not get to clock out. Your body does not get to soften. You do not get to be a person. You become a perimeter.

And I am sick of living like a perimeter.

### I am naming what is real

I do not want pity. I want reality to be spoken plainly, because plain reality is harder to dismiss.

This is not normal.  
This is not acceptable.  
This is not just how it is.

A fenced-in, abandoned property with doors being kicked in and no staff on site is not a rough patch. It is a failure. Structural, managerial, human.

And it is happening while the system asks me to keep everything tidy, polite, and on time.

So here is the clean truth.

I am scared sometimes.  
I am functioning anyway.

I am documenting.  
I am building.  
I am showing up for my kid.  
I am trying to keep my nervous system from learning the wrong lessons.

Because that is the part people do not understand about sustained instability. It does not just hurt you once. It trains you.

It trains you to expect abandonment.  
It trains you to distrust silence.  
It trains you to live on alert.

And I do not want to become the kind of person who can only survive by staying armored. Not because armor is bad, but because armor is heavy.

### A small vow

If I do not anchor myself to something, this kind of life will start rewriting me.

So here is my vow, small and real.

I am going to get out of this environment.  
I am going to keep building things that outlast negligence.  
I am going to keep showing up for my son like he is the clearest signal in my life.  
I am going to keep telling the truth in a world that survives by downplaying it.

And when this chapter ends, I want a record that I did not disappear just because the system tried to make me quiet.

I was here.  
I saw what happened.  
And I kept going.
