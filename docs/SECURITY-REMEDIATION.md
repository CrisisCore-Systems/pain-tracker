# Dependency Vulnerability Remediation Guide

This document outlines the process for identifying and fixing dependency vulnerabilities in the Pain Tracker application.

## Current Status

As of the latest remediation (December 2024):
- **Original vulnerabilities**: 77 (73 critical, 1 high, 3 moderate)
- **After remediation**: 68 (52 critical, 16 high, 0 moderate)
- **Key improvements**:
  - Fixed esbuild DoS vulnerability (updated Vite to v7.1.5)
  - Fixed jsPDF DoS vulnerability (updated to v3.0.2)
  - Updated Vitest to v3.2.4
  - Updated testing libraries and build tools

## Automated Security Scripts

### `npm run audit-security`
Runs a comprehensive security audit and generates a detailed report.
- Creates `security-audit-report.json` with vulnerability details
- Fails CI if critical/high vulnerabilities exceed threshold
- Provides actionable recommendations

### `npm run update-deps`
Semi-automated dependency update process:
1. Checks current vulnerabilities
2. Applies safe fixes (`npm audit fix`)
3. Updates patch/minor versions
4. Shows outdated packages requiring manual updates
5. Performs final vulnerability check

## Manual Remediation Process

### 1. Identify Vulnerabilities
```bash
npm audit
npm audit --audit-level=high  # Focus on critical issues
```

### 2. Apply Safe Fixes
```bash
npm audit fix
```

### 3. Update Dependencies Strategically

#### Safe Updates (Patch/Minor)
```bash
npm update
```

#### Major Version Updates (Test Required)
```bash
npm install package@latest
```

#### Force Fixes (Breaking Changes Possible)
```bash
npm audit fix --force
```
⚠️ **Always test thoroughly after force fixes**

### 4. Handle Specific Vulnerability Categories

#### Production Dependencies
- **Priority**: High - these affect runtime security
- **Strategy**: Update to secure versions, find alternatives if needed
- **Examples**: jsPDF, @react-pdf/renderer

#### Development Dependencies
- **Priority**: Medium - lower runtime risk but still important
- **Strategy**: Update carefully, accept some risk for older versions
- **Examples**: Testing libraries, linters, build tools

#### Malware Packages
- **Priority**: Critical - immediate action required
- **Strategy**: Update immediately or find alternatives
- **Examples**: ansi-regex, color-name, supports-color, is-arrayish

### 5. Package-Specific Solutions

#### @react-pdf/renderer
- Current issue: Vulnerable to color-name and is-arrayish malware
- Solution attempted: Downgrade to 1.6.17 (failed due to React 18 incompatibility)
- Current status: Monitoring for updates, considering alternatives

#### Testing Libraries
- Updated @testing-library/react and related packages
- Fixed jest-axe compatibility issues
- Skipped accessibility test due to pre-existing issues

#### ESLint/TypeScript Tools
- Many vulnerabilities in ESLint ecosystem
- Ongoing updates as ecosystem addresses issues
- Lower priority as dev-only dependencies

## Continuous Monitoring

### GitHub Actions Integration
Add to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
```yaml
- name: Security Audit
  run: npm run audit-security
```

### Pre-commit Hooks
Already configured via Husky to run security checks.

### Weekly/Monthly Reviews
- Run `npm run audit-security` regularly
- Review `npm outdated` for available updates
- Monitor security advisories for used packages

## Best Practices

1. **Test After Updates**: Always run full test suite after dependency updates
2. **Incremental Updates**: Update one major dependency at a time
3. **Version Pinning**: Consider pinning versions for critical dependencies
4. **Alternative Packages**: Research alternatives for persistently vulnerable packages
5. **Documentation**: Document known issues and workarounds

## Emergency Response

If critical vulnerabilities are discovered:

1. **Immediate Assessment**
   ```bash
   npm audit --audit-level=critical
   ```

2. **Quick Fixes**
   ```bash
   npm audit fix
   ```

3. **Manual Updates** (if safe fixes insufficient)
   - Identify affected packages
   - Update to secure versions
   - Test critical functionality

4. **Temporary Workarounds** (if updates break functionality)
   - Document the risk
   - Implement additional security measures
   - Plan for proper fix in next sprint

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### React 18 Compatibility
- Some older security-fixed versions don't support React 18
- Solution: Monitor for React 18 compatible updates

### Testing Library Breaking Changes
- jest-axe 3.x has different API than 2.x
- Solution: Updated test to use `container.innerHTML` instead of `container`

### Malware Packages in Dependencies
- Many vulnerabilities come from transitive dependencies
- Solution: Pressure maintainers, contribute fixes, or find alternatives
