## 🔌 Integration Guide

### How to Use in Your App:

```typescript
// 1. Import the main dashboard
import { AnalyticsDashboard } from './components/analytics';

// 2. Add to your route or page
<AnalyticsDashboard className="my-8" />

// That's it! The dashboard automatically pulls data from:
// - usePainTrackerStore().entries (pain data)
// - usePainTrackerStore().moodEntries (mood data)
```

### Individual Component Usage:

```typescript
// For custom layouts, use individual components
import {
  CorrelationMatrixView,
  InterventionScorecard,
  TriggerPatternTimeline,
  PredictiveIndicatorPanel,
  WeeklyClinicalBriefCard,
} from './components/analytics';

// Process data manually
const engine = new AdvancedAnalyticsEngine();
const correlations = engine.calculateCorrelationMatrix(entries, moodEntries);
const interventions = engine.scoreInterventions(entries);
const triggers = engine.detectTriggerPatterns(entries);
const indicators = engine.identifyPredictiveIndicators(entries);
const brief = engine.generateWeeklyClinicalBrief(entries, moodEntries);

// Render individual components
<CorrelationMatrixView correlations={correlations} />
<InterventionScorecard interventions={interventions} />
<TriggerPatternTimeline patterns={triggers} />
<PredictiveIndicatorPanel indicators={indicators} />
<WeeklyClinicalBriefCard brief={brief} />
```
