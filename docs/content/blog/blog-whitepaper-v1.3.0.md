# Pain Tracker whitepaper v1.3.0 (PDF)

I’ve published a publication‑grade whitepaper for Pain Tracker v1.3.0.

- Download: https://paintracker.ca/whitepaper
- GitHub Release: https://github.com/CrisisCore-Systems/pain-tracker/releases/tag/whitepaper-v1.3.0

This is a plain-language, privacy-first overview of the app’s goals and architecture (offline-first, local-first by default), plus the trust boundaries we *do* and *don’t* claim.

If you’re evaluating pain diaries for clinical use, or you’re building health tooling and want to avoid surveillance-by-default patterns, this may be useful.
