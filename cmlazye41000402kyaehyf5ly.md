## Why fibromyalgia requires multi-symptom tracking

Fibromyalgia is more than a pain condition. The diagnostic criteria explicitly include widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and cognitive difficulties. Tracking only pain intensity misses at least half of the clinical picture. Effective fibromyalgia management requires a multi-dimensional tracking approach that captures the full symptom constellation.

PainTracker's structured entry system supports this multi-symptom approach. Beyond the core pain fields—intensity, location, quality—you can use tags and notes to consistently record fatigue levels, sleep quality, cognitive fog severity, and other symptoms relevant to your specific fibromyalgia presentation. This comprehensive data gives your rheumatologist or pain specialist the full picture they need.

## Tracking widespread pain with body mapping

Fibromyalgia pain is characteristically widespread and often migratory—it may be concentrated in different areas on different days. The body map in PainTracker lets you record exactly where pain is located each day, building a visual history that shows distribution patterns, migration trends, and whether new areas are becoming involved.

This location tracking is clinically valuable for distinguishing fibromyalgia from other conditions with more localised pain patterns. It also helps identify whether treatments are reducing the number of affected areas (a sign of improvement that intensity scores alone might not capture).

## Fatigue and sleep tracking alongside pain

Fatigue in fibromyalgia is not ordinary tiredness—it is a profound exhaustion that does not resolve with rest. Tracking fatigue alongside pain reveals important relationships: whether fatigue follows high-pain days, whether poor sleep predicts both fatigue and pain the next day, and whether medications affect fatigue independently of their pain relief.

Sleep quality data is particularly important because non-restorative sleep is both a symptom and a driver of fibromyalgia. Recording sleep duration, quality, and the number of awakenings alongside morning pain levels can reveal whether sleep interventions are affecting your overall symptom burden.

## Identifying flare patterns and triggers

Fibromyalgia flares can seem random, but consistent tracking often reveals patterns that are invisible to memory. Weather changes, hormonal cycles, stress events, overexertion, and sleep disruption are common triggers that emerge from tracked data. Identifying your personal triggers allows proactive management—adjusting activity levels, pre-medicating before known triggers, and communicating patterns to your care team.

PainTracker's local analytics can highlight time-of-day patterns, day-of-week variations, and correlations between pain levels and tracked variables. Because all analysis happens on your device, you can explore sensitive patterns—like the relationship between workplace stress and symptom severity—without worrying about who else might see the data.

## Communicating fibromyalgia data to clinicians

Fibromyalgia remains a condition that some clinicians are sceptical about, partly because traditional clinical assessments often appear normal. Structured, consistent symptom data provides objective evidence of your symptom burden that supports your lived experience. A four-week export showing daily pain levels, fatigue scores, sleep data, and functional impacts is far more convincing than a verbal report.

When preparing for appointments, export data that covers the period since your last visit. Highlight medication changes and their apparent effects, new patterns you have noticed, and any functional changes. This structured presentation facilitates productive clinical conversations about treatment adjustments.
