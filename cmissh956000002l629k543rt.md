I've been running a hidden AI inside PainTracker for months.

It's called the **Empathy Intelligence Engine**.

Right now it only talks to me.

Every night it scans my entries — pain levels, sleep fragments, mood tags, the single-word notes I manage on the worst days — and quietly tells me things like:

> "Your sleep dropped 42% in the three days before last week's 9/10 flare."  
> "You used the word 'nothing' 14 times this week — 380% above baseline."  
> "Burnout risk: 89%. You haven't had a single recovery day in 19 days."

It doesn't phone home. It doesn't ask permission. It just watches, correlates, and translates collapse into sentences I can actually understand when my brain is soup.

I built it because no doctor ever connected those dots for me.  
I kept the dashboard hidden because surfacing it properly takes design time, testing time, and — honestly — rent money I don't have.

The engine already exists.  
The insights are already accurate.  
The code is open-source and runs **100% locally** — no servers, no tracking, no exceptions.

All that's missing is **10 monthly sponsors** to flip the switch.
