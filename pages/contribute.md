# Contribute to Pain Tracker

Pain Tracker Pro is an open-source project built by survivors, for survivors. We are looking for contributors who care about privacy, accessibility, and trauma-informed design.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack

We use a modern, type-safe stack focused on performance and local persistence:

*   **Framework:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
*   **State Management:** Zustand + Immer
*   **Database:** IndexedDB (via IDB wrapper)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Testing:** Vitest + Playwright
*   **Validation:** Zod

## 🤝 How You Can Help

We welcome contributions of all kinds, not just code.

### 1. Code Contributions
*   **Accessibility Audits:** Help us validate against a WCAG 2.2 AA target.
*   **Performance:** Optimize our Service Worker and IndexedDB queries.
*   **Features:** Check our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/CrisisCore-Systems/pain-tracker/issues) for "good first issue" tags.

### 2. Documentation
*   Improve our README and setup guides.
*   Write tutorials or use-cases.

### 3. Testing
*   Test the app on different devices and report bugs.
*   Help us write better end-to-end tests.

## 🚫 What We Are NOT Looking For

*   **Tracking/Analytics:** We will not accept PRs that add third-party tracking pixels, analytics SDKs (like Google Analytics), or any code that sends user data to a remote server without explicit, opt-in consent.
*   **Growth Hacking:** We optimize for user trust, not "engagement" or "retention" metrics.
