# Why Pain Tracker?

Most health apps are surveillance tools disguised as helpers. They track your location, sell your data to advertisers, and leak your most sensitive moments to the highest bidder.

**Pain Tracker Pro is different.**

It was built by a chronic pain survivor who needed a tool that was safe, fast, and reliable—even when the internet wasn't.

## 🛡️ Built Different

### 1. Local-First & Private
Your data lives on your device. It is stored in an encrypted database (IndexedDB) inside your browser. We have no servers to hack, no database to subpoena, and no way to see your data even if we wanted to.

### 2. No Accounts Required
You don't need to sign up, give us your email, or create a password to start. Just open the app and go. This lowers the barrier to entry for people in crisis.

### 3. Trauma-Informed Design
We don't judge you. There are no "streaks" to maintain, no shaming notifications if you miss a day, and no toxic positivity. The interface is designed to be calming and usable even during high-pain episodes.

### 4. WorkSafeBC Automation
For workers in British Columbia, the app automates the generation of "Form 6" reports. What used to take 15-20 hours of manual logging now takes minutes.

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

*   **Chronic Pain Patients:** Track symptoms, medications, and triggers to find patterns.
*   **BC Workers:** Document injuries for compensation claims with clinical-grade precision.
*   **Privacy Advocates:** Use a health tool that respects your digital rights.
*   **Developers:** See how a local-first PWA is built in the real world.

## 🔄 How It Works

1.  **Log:** Tap a few buttons to record pain levels, symptoms, and medications.
2.  **Analyze:** View charts and correlations right on your device.
3.  **Export:** Generate PDF or CSV reports for your doctor or lawyer.
4.  **Wipe:** Delete everything instantly if you need to.
