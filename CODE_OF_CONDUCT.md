# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in Pain Tracker a safe, respectful, and empowering experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to acting in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, and inclusive community—especially recognizing the unique challenges faced by people living with chronic pain and disabilities.
