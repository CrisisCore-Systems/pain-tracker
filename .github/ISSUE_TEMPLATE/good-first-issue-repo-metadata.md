## 🎯 Goal

Improve the repository's discoverability on GitHub by adding relevant topics and updating the About section with a concise, clear description.

## 📋 Background

GitHub topics and the About section help users discover repositories through search and browsing. Well-chosen topics improve SEO and help potential contributors find the project.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

1. **Add GitHub Topics** (via Settings > General > Topics):
   - [ ] Add at least 10 relevant topics from this list:
     - `pain-tracking`
     - `healthcare`
     - `chronic-pain`
     - `fibromyalgia`
     - `privacy-first`
     - `offline-first`
     - `local-first`
     - `typescript`
     - `react`
     - `accessibility`
     - `wcag`
     - `trauma-informed`
     - `worksafebc`
     - `medical-records`
     - `pwa`
   - [ ] Ensure topics are lowercase and use hyphens (not spaces or underscores)

2. **Update About Section** (via Settings > General > About):
   - [ ] Add a concise description (max 350 characters):
     - Example: "Security-first, offline-capable chronic pain tracking app with clinical-grade exports, trauma-informed design, and WorkSafeBC support. Local-first architecture with WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility."
   - [ ] Update the Website URL to: `https://paintracker.ca`
   - [ ] Ensure the description highlights key features: privacy, offline, accessibility, clinical use

3. **Verification**:
   - [ ] Check that topics appear correctly on the repository page
   - [ ] Verify the About section is visible and readable
   - [ ] Test that searching for 1-2 topics on GitHub returns this repository
