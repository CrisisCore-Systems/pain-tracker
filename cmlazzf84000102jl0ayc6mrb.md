## The paradox of private health data sharing

Private health tracking creates a paradox: you need privacy to track honestly, but you need to share data to benefit from clinical care. The resolution is not choosing between privacy and sharing—it is controlling the sharing process so that you decide what is shared, with whom, in what format, and for what purpose. PainTracker is designed around this principle of controlled disclosure.

Selective sharing means that different recipients get different views of your data. Your physiotherapist sees functional impact and exercise response data for the past month. Your prescriber sees medication-pain correlations over three months. Your insurance reviewer sees the WorkSafeBC-formatted timeline. None of them need or receive your complete unfiltered history.

## Choosing what to share

Before exporting, consider what data is relevant to the recipient and purpose. For a medical appointment, include pain intensity trends, medication logs, functional impacts, and any patterns you have noticed. For an insurance claim, include timeline evidence, functional documentation, and treatment compliance records. For a second opinion, include a comprehensive summary.

Exclude entries that are irrelevant to the purpose. Personal notes, emotional processing, entries from unrelated health conditions, and data outside the relevant date range do not need to be in every export. PainTracker's selective export controls let you choose date ranges and data fields for each export independently.

## Understanding export format security

Exported files—PDF, CSV, and JSON—are not encrypted by default. They are designed to be human-readable and clinically useful. This means that once you export a file, anyone with access to that file can read its contents. Treat exported pain reports with the same care you would give any medical document.

Do not email unencrypted exports over public Wi-Fi. Do not leave printed reports in shared spaces. Do not save exports to shared cloud drives unless you intend for others to access them. If you need to transmit data electronically, use a secure messaging platform or your clinic's patient portal if available.

## Sharing with different stakeholders

For clinicians: print a PDF and bring it to your appointment, or share it through your clinic's secure patient portal. Doctors prefer PDF because it prints cleanly and can be added to your chart.

For insurance and WorkSafeBC: use the WorkSafeBC export template, which formats data according to documentation expectations. Share through the claims representative or your advocating lawyer, keeping a copy for your records.

For personal support (family, advocates): share only what you are comfortable sharing. A summary PDF covering a specific period may be appropriate. You are never obligated to share your complete tracking history with anyone.

## Revoking and managing shared data

Once you share a file, you cannot revoke access—the recipient has a copy. This is why selective exports matter: share only what is appropriate for each situation, so that no single recipient receives more than they need.

Keep your own records of what you shared, with whom, and when. This audit trail helps you manage your health data disclosures over time and ensures you know exactly what information each provider or insurer has received. PainTracker's local-only architecture means your master copy always remains under your exclusive control.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I share just part of my pain diary?

Yes. PainTracker's export controls let you select specific date ranges and data fields. You can create different exports for different recipients, sharing only what is relevant to each.

### Are exported files encrypted?

No. Exported PDF, CSV, and JSON files are designed to be human-readable. Treat them as you would any medical document—handle and transmit them securely.

### What is the safest way to send my pain report to a doctor?

The safest method is to print the PDF and hand it to your doctor in person. If electronic sharing is needed, use your clinic's secure patient portal or an encrypted messaging platform.
