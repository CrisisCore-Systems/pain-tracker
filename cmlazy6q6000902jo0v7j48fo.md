## Why PDF export matters for pain management

A pain log that cannot be shared is a personal journal—valuable for self-awareness but limited in clinical impact. The ability to export structured pain data as a professional PDF report transforms your diary into a communication tool between you and your healthcare providers, insurance reviewers, and legal advocates.

PDF is the universally accepted document format in healthcare. It prints cleanly, displays consistently across devices, can be attached to medical records, and is accepted by insurance companies and legal proceedings. Unlike proprietary app formats or screenshots, a PDF export provides a self-contained, professional document that stands on its own.

## What a clinical PDF report includes

PainTracker's PDF export is designed for clinical contexts, not visual appeal. The report includes a summary section with date range, total entries, average pain intensity, peak pain levels, and most common pain locations. Trend charts show pain intensity over time, giving clinicians an immediate visual overview of the tracking period.

Below the summary, the report includes a medication log showing what was taken and when, functional impact data documenting the real-world effects of pain on daily activities, and individual entry details for clinicians who want to examine specific days. The layout follows medical documentation conventions: summary first, details second, in a format that healthcare providers are trained to read.

## User-controlled data sharing

Every PainTracker export is user-initiated. Nothing leaves your device automatically, and you control exactly what is included. Select a date range, choose which data fields appear in the report, and generate the PDF locally. The export process runs entirely in your browser—no server processes your data at any point.

This control matters because different providers need different data. Your physiotherapist might need functional impact details and body location maps. Your prescribing physician needs medication-response correlations. An insurance reviewer needs consistent intensity documentation and timeline evidence. PainTracker lets you tailor each export to its intended audience.

## Export formats beyond PDF

While PDF is the most common choice for clinical sharing, PainTracker also supports CSV and JSON exports. CSV provides raw tabular data that clinicians or researchers can analyse in spreadsheet software, apply their own statistical methods, or import into clinical databases. Each row represents one entry with standardised columns.

JSON export captures the complete data structure and is intended for technical backup and data portability. If you ever need to move your data to another tool or maintain a machine-readable archive, JSON preserves the full fidelity of your records including structured fields that CSV flattens.

## WorkSafeBC-specific exports

Workers' compensation claims in British Columbia require specific documentation that demonstrates the relationship between a workplace injury and ongoing symptoms. PainTracker includes a WorkSafeBC export template that structures your pain data according to the documentation expectations of WCB adjudicators.

The template emphasises timeline evidence linking injury dates to symptom onset, consistent documentation of pain levels and functional limitations, medication management records, and treatment compliance evidence. This structured approach helps ensure that your claim is supported by the kind of documentation that reviewers expect and understand.

## Best practices for exporting and sharing

Export reports before your appointment so you can review them first. Check that the date range covers the relevant period and that the data tells the story you want your provider to understand. Print the report if your clinic works with paper records, or save it to your phone for electronic sharing.

Remember that exported PDF and CSV files are not encrypted—they are designed to be human-readable. Handle them with the same care you would give any medical document. Do not email them over unsecured channels if the content is sensitive, and delete copies from shared devices after use.
