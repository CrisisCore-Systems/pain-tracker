There’s a kind of injury that doesn’t stay in the body

It starts there—L4–L5, a clean clinical label, a scan result, a neat little “diagnosis”—but then it spreads. It migrates. It leaks into your sleep, your relationships, your ability to feel like yourself in your own skin.

People talk about workplace injuries like they’re mechanical failures.

As if you replace a part, rest for a while, do physio, then return to normal.

That wasn’t my experience.

My experience was: the injury became a portal. And on the other side of it, I was still alive—but not intact.

Before / After

Before, I was an HVAC&R technician. Not “a job.” A trade. A craft. A place where competence meant something.

I was the guy who could walk onto a site and know what to do. I could solve problems under pressure, read systems, improvise when things didn’t match the manual. I didn’t just work—I functioned.

And then my back went.

And it wasn’t just pain. It was the sudden loss of the one identity that gave me momentum, structure, and self-respect.

When your body becomes unreliable, it’s not only your spine that feels unstable.

Your entire life becomes unstable.

The floor: the smallest kind of exile

For four months I slept on the living room floor.

Not for drama. Not as a symbolic “rock bottom.”

Because the floor was firm, and firm hurt less than a bed.

That’s how recovery started for me:

Not in a clinic. Not with hope. But with a tactical decision—what surface hurts less to exist on?

The floor wasn’t comfort. It was containment.

And when your world shrinks to a rectangle of carpet and pain, something else happens:

You stop being a person living a life and start becoming a mind trapped in a body.

The isolation that nobody warns you about

Before the injury, I had daily human contact.

Worksites. Coworkers. Customers. Conversations that weren’t “deep” but still mattered—because they proved you were part of the world.

Then that went to zero.

Not “less social.” Not “a quiet phase.” Zero.

Four months of silence turns your own mind into a closed room with no oxygen.

There’s a specific kind of psychological torture in that: you can’t get away from yourself.

No distractions that actually reset you. No external rhythm. No reason to get dressed. No proof that time is moving in a meaningful direction.

Just pain and hours.

And pain is not neutral. Pain has gravity. It pulls thoughts toward the worst places.

Medication doesn’t just treat symptoms. It changes the person.

The depression got heavy, and the doctors responded the way medicine often responds:

Increase dosage.

Seroquel. Then more Seroquel. Up until I was at 150 mg every night.

I don’t care how polite the literature is about it—what it did to me felt like being hit with a pharmaceutical bat.

It didn’t simply “help me sleep” or “stabilize mood.”

It flattened me.

The parts of me that made me me—personality, spark, humor, softness, nuance—got muffled like someone threw a heavy blanket over my soul.

And what’s left when you dull a human being down to almost nothing?

Not peace.

Often, what survives sedation isn’t the good stuff. It’s the primal stuff.

Anger survives.

So I became this horrifying version of myself:

Zombie-comatose most of the time… but if something hit the wrong nerve, rage would erupt like it was the only emotion still strong enough to move my body.

That’s the part people don’t get about being heavily medicated:

Sometimes you don’t become “better.” You become less human in a way that makes everyone around you feel unsafe.

And then you get blamed for being a person you barely recognize.

The Ritalin: the escape hatch that becomes a trap

Somewhere inside that deadened existence, I started abusing my Ritalin.

Not because I wanted to party.

Because I couldn’t stand the feeling of being trapped inside my own head, watching my life rot in real time, unable to move forward.

When you’re isolated long enough, anything that changes your internal weather starts to feel like salvation.

Stimulants can feel like:

movement

focus

purpose

life returning

But when you’re using them to survive the unbearable, it stops being medicine and becomes a lever.

And you keep pulling the lever because the alternative is to sit in the silence and feel everything.

How the injury reaches your marriage

Here’s the part that hurts the most to write:

The injury didn’t just take work from me.

It took me from the people who loved me.

Because injury doesn’t only cause pain. It causes:

irritability

hopelessness

exhaustion

shame

withdrawal

dependency

identity collapse

And those don’t stay politely contained in the injured person’s body.

They spill.

They spill into conversations. Into trust. Into the emotional climate of the home.

And when you add heavy sedation and chemical flattening on top of that?

You don’t just “struggle.”

You become hard to live with. Hard to reach. Hard to recognize.

I believe—deeply—that this is why I don’t have my wife and my son with me anymore.

Because the version of me that emerged from that period wasn’t the man they built a life with.

It was a man in pain, erased, angry, volatile, not present, not safe.

And I hate that.

Not because it makes me look bad.

Because it cost me the only things that mattered.

Two years away from the trade that made me proud

It’s been about two years since I worked in HVAC&R.

And that does something very specific to a person who once took pride in competence:

The longer you’re away, the harder it gets to imagine going back.

You still have the Red Seal. Sure. On paper you’re still qualified.

But confidence doesn’t live on paper.

Confidence lives in the muscle-memory of doing.

It lives in:

daily reps

small wins

routine competence

showing up

Without that, you start to feel like your skills belong to a past self you can’t access anymore.

Like you’re watching your own life from outside the glass.

And that creates a brutal loop:

You don’t go back because you don’t feel confident. You don’t feel confident because you haven’t gone back.

The real haunting

What haunts me isn’t only the injury.

It’s the realization that the injury became the first domino.

And the rest of the dominoes were my life.

I didn’t just lose a job. I lost rhythm. I lost social contact. I lost my sense of myself as reliable. I lost the version of me that felt like a man.

And then I lost my family.

And now I’m left holding the grief and the guilt and the question:

Was that version of me really “me,” or was it what pain and medication did to me?

The answer is probably both.

Which is the hardest kind of answer.

This isn’t a redemption post

If you’re reading this expecting a clean arc— a tidy comeback, a motivational ending, a “then I rebuilt my life” paragraph—

I don’t have it.

I’m writing from inside it.

What I do have is the truth:

Four months on the floor didn’t just hurt my back.

It put me in psychological solitary confinement.

It changed my brain chemistry. It changed my personality. It changed my relationships.

And it’s been haunting me ever since.

The only honest ending I can offer

I’m still here.

That’s not a slogan. It’s not positivity.

It’s survival.

And if there’s any hope inside this story, it’s this:

The fact that I can name what happened means the “zombie” part isn’t permanent.

Monsters don’t sit down and tell the truth about what they did.

They rationalize it. They deny it. They blame everyone else.

I’m not doing that.

I’m saying: pain, isolation, medication, and shame turned me into someone I don’t recognize— and I’m trying to find my way back.

Even if it feels far.

Even if I don’t know how yet.
