## There’s a kind of injury that doesn’t stay in the body

It starts there—**L4–L5**.  
A clean clinical label. A scan result. A neat little *diagnosis*.

But then it spreads.  
It migrates.  
It leaks into your sleep, your relationships, your ability to feel like yourself in your own skin.

People talk about workplace injuries like they’re **mechanical failures**—  
as if you replace a part, rest for a while, do physio, then return to normal.

That wasn’t my experience.

My experience was this:

**The injury became a portal.**  
And on the other side of it, I was still alive—  
**but not intact.**

---

## Before / After

Before, I was an **HVAC&R technician**.  
Not just “a job.” A **trade**. A **craft**.  
A place where competence meant something.

I was the guy who could walk onto a site and know what to do.  
Solve problems under pressure.  
Read systems.  
Improvise when reality didn’t match the manual.

I didn’t just work.  
**I functioned.**

And then my back went.

And it wasn’t just pain.  
It was the sudden loss of the one identity that gave me:

* momentum
    
* structure
    
* self-respect
    

When your body becomes unreliable,  
it’s not only your spine that feels unstable.

**Your entire life becomes unstable.**

## The floor: the smallest kind of exile

For **four months**, I slept on the living room floor.

Not for drama.  
Not as a symbolic “rock bottom.”

Because the floor was **firm**,  
and firm hurt **less** than a bed.

That’s how recovery started for me:

Not in a clinic.  
Not with hope.  
But with a **tactical decision**—

> *What surface hurts less to exist on?*

The floor wasn’t comfort.  
It was **containment**.

And when your world shrinks to a rectangle of carpet and pain,  
something else happens:

You stop being a person living a life  
and start becoming  
**a mind trapped in a body.**

---

## The isolation nobody warns you about

Before the injury, I had **daily human contact**—  
worksites, coworkers, customers,  
conversations that weren’t deep but still mattered  
because they proved you were part of the world.

Then that went to **zero**.

Not “less social.”  
Not “a quiet phase.”

**Zero.**

Four months of silence turns your own mind  
into a closed room with no oxygen.

You can’t get away from yourself.  
No rhythm. No reason to get dressed.  
No proof that time is moving forward.

Just **pain** and **hours**.

And pain isn’t neutral.  
Pain has **gravity**.  
It pulls thoughts toward the worst places.

---

## Medication doesn’t just treat symptoms

### It changes the person

The depression got heavy.  
Medicine responded the way medicine often does:

**Increase dosage.**

Seroquel.  
Then more Seroquel.  
Up to **150 mg every night**.

Polite literature calls it stabilization.  
What it felt like was being hit  
with a **pharmaceutical bat**.

It didn’t just help me sleep.  
It **flattened** me.

Personality. Humor. Softness. Nuance.  
Muffled—like someone threw a heavy blanket over my soul.

And what’s left when you dull a human being to almost nothing?

Not peace.

Often, what survives sedation  
is the **primal** stuff.

**Anger survives.**

So I became a horrifying version of myself:

Zombie-still most of the time…  
but if something touched the wrong nerve,  
**rage erupted** like it was the only emotion strong enough to move my body.

That’s the part people don’t understand about heavy medication:

Sometimes you don’t become better.  
You become **less human** in a way that makes everyone around you feel unsafe.

And then you get blamed  
for being someone  
you barely recognize.

## The Ritalin: the escape hatch that becomes a trap

Inside that deadened existence,  
I started abusing my Ritalin.

Not to party.  
To escape the feeling of being trapped  
inside my own head,  
watching my life rot in real time.

When isolation lasts long enough,  
anything that changes your internal weather  
feels like **salvation**.

Stimulants can feel like:

* movement
    
* focus
    
* purpose
    
* life returning
    

But when you use them just to survive the unbearable,  
it stops being medicine  
and becomes a **lever**.

And you keep pulling the lever  
because the alternative is silence  
and feeling everything.

## How the injury reaches your marriage

This is the part that hurts most to write:

The injury didn’t just take work from me.  
It took **me** from the people who loved me.

Because injury doesn’t only cause pain.  
It causes:

* irritability
    
* hopelessness
    
* exhaustion
    
* shame
    
* withdrawal
    
* dependency
    
* identity collapse
    

And those don’t stay contained.  
They **spill**—into conversations, trust, the emotional climate of a home.

Add sedation and chemical flattening on top of that,  
and you don’t just struggle.

You become **hard to live with.  
Hard to reach.  
Hard to recognize.**

I believe—deeply—this is why  
I don’t have my wife and son with me anymore.

And I hate that.

Not because it makes me look bad.  
Because it cost me  
**the only things that mattered.**

---

## Two years away from the trade that made me proud

It’s been about **two years** since I worked in HVAC&R.

And that does something brutal to a person  
who once took pride in competence.

The longer you’re away,  
the harder it is to imagine going back.

You still have the **Red Seal**.  
On paper, you’re qualified.

But confidence doesn’t live on paper.  
Confidence lives in **doing**:

* daily reps
    
* small wins
    
* routine competence
    
* showing up
    

Without that,  
your skills feel like they belong  
to a **past self** you can’t reach.

And the loop becomes vicious:

You don’t go back because you lack confidence.  
You lack confidence because you haven’t gone back.

## The real haunting

What haunts me isn’t only the injury.

It’s realizing the injury  
was the **first domino**.

And the rest of the dominoes  
were my life.

I lost rhythm.  
Contact.  
Identity.  
Family.

And I’m left with grief, guilt, and a question:

> Was that version of me really me,  
> or what pain and medication did to me?

The answer is probably **both**.

Which is the hardest answer.

## This isn’t a redemption post

If you’re expecting a tidy comeback,  
a motivational ending,  
a clean arc of rebuilding—

I don’t have it.

I’m writing from **inside** it.

What I do have is the truth:

Four months on the floor  
didn’t just hurt my back.

It put me in **psychological solitary confinement**.  
Changed my brain chemistry.  
Changed my relationships.  
Changed **me**.

And it’s haunted me ever since.

---

## The only honest ending I can offer

I’m still here.

Not positivity.  
Not a slogan.

**Survival.**

And maybe the smallest piece of hope is this:

The fact that I can name what happened  
means the “zombie” part  
isn’t permanent.

Monsters don’t tell the truth  
about what they did.

They deny.  
Blame.  
Rationalize.

I’m not doing that.

I’m saying:

Pain, isolation, medication, and shame  
turned me into someone I don’t recognize—

and I’m trying to find my way back.

Even if it feels far.  
Even if I don’t know how yet.
