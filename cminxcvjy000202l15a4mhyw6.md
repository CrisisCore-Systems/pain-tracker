# She Hit “Accept” Smiling. Twenty Minutes Later Her Worst Days Belonged to a Corporation.

Last Tuesday, I sat across from my friend Sarah as she excitedly downloaded yet another pain tracking app. Her face lit up as she scrolled through the features. "Look, it's completely free! And it connects to my Fitbit!"

I watched her thumb through the permission requests without a second glance. Location? Sure. Health data access? Obviously. Those endless terms of service? Who has time for that, right?

Twenty minutes later, every intimate detail of her chronic pain journey—those raw 3 AM journal entries about feeling hopeless, her medication experiments, the days she couldn't get out of bed—all of it was sitting on some server halfway across the world. Legally available for "research partnerships" and whatever else they felt like doing with it.

Sarah thought she'd found a helpful health tool. What she'd actually done was hand over the most vulnerable parts of herself to strangers who saw dollar signs where she saw suffering.

That's when it really hit me: we're living in a world where our pain has become someone else's profit.

## The Ugly Truth About "Free" Healthcare Tech

Here's what nobody in Silicon Valley wants you to figure out: **when a health app doesn't cost you money, your medical data becomes the currency.**

Think about it. These aren't just casual apps we're talking about. Your pain tracker isn't your Instagram feed. It contains some of the most personal, sensitive information imaginable:

* Every medication you've tried (and which ones failed)
    
* Your mental health during the worst flare-ups
    
* When and where your symptoms hit hardest
    
* Those desperate notes you type at 2 AM when everything hurts
    
* How your condition affects your relationships, work, sleep
    

When you hand all of that over for "free," you're not getting healthcare. You're getting surveilled by people who've figured out how to monetize human suffering.

## How These Apps Actually Make Their Money (Spoiler: It's Not Pretty)

Let me pull back the curtain on what really happens to your health data:

### Your Pain Diary Has a Price Tag

Most health apps bury language in their privacy policies about sharing "anonymized data with research partners." Sounds harmless enough, doesn't it?

Here's the reality: there's a thriving marketplace where companies buy and sell information about people with chronic conditions. Depression, anxiety, chronic pain, autoimmune diseases—all of it has a price. Studies show they can usually figure out who you are from just your ZIP code, birth date, and gender.

A recent Duke University study found that health data brokers openly sell detailed information about people's medical conditions for less than a dollar per person. Your years of pain tracking? It's worth about as much as a candy bar to them.

### When Ads Know Too Much

Ever notice how after using a pain tracking app, you suddenly start seeing ads for pain clinics, disability lawyers, and "miracle" treatments? That's not a coincidence.

These apps often integrate with dozens of advertising networks that build detailed profiles of your health struggles. Open your pain tracker in the morning, and by afternoon you're being targeted based on your most vulnerable moments.

### The Premium Trap

Here's how they hook you: the free version collects all your data but makes actually using it frustrating. Want to see trends in your pain levels? That'll be $9.99 a month. Need to export your own data for a doctor's appointment? Premium feature. Want more than basic tracking? Pay up.

They've figured out the perfect formula: make the free tier just useful enough to harvest your information, but annoying enough that you'll eventually pay for features that should have been free all along.

## The Fine Print Nobody Reads (But Really Should)

I spent way too many hours last month reading through the privacy policies of popular health apps. What I found made my skin crawl.

One popular pain tracker's policy casually mentions they "may share information with our parent company, Boston Scientific Corporation." Boston Scientific? They make spinal cord stimulators and chronic pain devices. Your pain data is literally feeding into their sales pipeline.

Another app requires you to create a cloud account just to track your symptoms locally. Why? Because they need your data on their servers where they can access it, not trapped on your device where it might actually stay private.

The language is always so carefully crafted: "We may share data with affiliates and partners." "Anonymized information may be used for research purposes." "Data may be transferred to servers in other countries."

Translation: your most intimate medical details are up for grabs, and there's pretty much nothing you can do about it once you hit that "Accept" button.

## What Real Privacy Actually Looks Like

This is where I have to be upfront about my bias—I built [Pain Tracker](https://paintracker.ca) specifically because I was horrified by what I discovered about health app privacy. But let me show you what it means when an app actually respects your data:

### Your Data Never Leaves Your Device

With most apps, your information goes: You → Their Servers → Data Brokers → Whoever Pays the Most.

With a truly private approach, it's just: You → Your Device. End of story.

There's no server to hack, no database to breach, no "anonymized research" to mysteriously appear in corporate boardrooms.

### Actually Encrypted (Not Just Marketing Speak)

Lots of apps claim to be "encrypted," but they only encrypt the connection to their servers. Once your data arrives, it's sitting there in plain text, readable by anyone with access.

Real privacy means your data is encrypted on your device with a key only you control. Even if someone somehow got their hands on your information, it would be completely meaningless gibberish.

### You Can See the Code

When an app promises "we don't sell your data," how can you verify that? With closed-source software, you can't. You just have to trust them.

Open-source apps let anyone examine the code. Security researchers can spot vulnerabilities, privacy advocates can verify claims, and you can see exactly what the software does with your information.

## How to Audit Your Current Health Apps

Before you trust any app with your health data, run through this reality check:

### The Basic Questions

Start here, even if you're not tech-savvy:

**Can you export your data easily?** If getting your own information back requires paying money or jumping through hoops, that's a red flag. Your data should be yours to take whenever you want.

**What permissions does the app request?** A pain tracker doesn't need access to your contacts, location, or camera. Excessive permissions usually mean data harvesting.

**Who owns the company?** Do a quick Google search. If the parent company makes money from data sales or has partnerships with insurers or pharma companies, your data is likely feeding into their business model.

### The Technical Check

If you're comfortable digging deeper:

**Where is your data stored?** Local-only storage is ideal. Cloud storage with encryption where you control the keys is acceptable. Cloud storage where the company can read your data is a problem.

**Does it work offline?** If an app requires an internet connection for basic features that should work locally, your data is probably being uploaded somewhere.

**Is the code open source?** Closed-source health apps are essentially asking you to trust them blindly with your most sensitive information.

### The Deal-Breakers

Some things should make you uninstall immediately:

**Advertising in a health app.** Your pain shouldn't be monetized through targeted ads.

**Required account creation for local features.** This is usually a tracking mechanism disguised as a feature.

**Vague privacy policies.** If you can't understand how your data is used, assume the worst.

## Better Alternatives That Actually Respect You

Here are some options that pass the privacy test:

For pain tracking specifically, there's [Pain Tracker](https://paintracker.ca)—yes, my project, so take this recommendation with appropriate skepticism. But it's 100% local storage, fully encrypted, completely open source, and works entirely offline. Your data never leaves your device.

For general health tracking, look into **Gadgetbridge** if you use fitness trackers—it's open source and keeps all your data local instead of sending it to corporate servers.

For mental health, **Youper** processes everything on your device instead of in the cloud.

The key is finding tools built by people who understand that your health data isn't a commodity. It's a deeply personal record of your journey, and it deserves to be treated with respect.

---

## Why This Really Matters

This isn't just about avoiding annoying ads or protecting some abstract notion of privacy. Health data in the wrong hands has real consequences:

**Insurance companies are getting creative.** Your pain tracking history could theoretically affect life insurance rates, disability claims, or health coverage decisions.

**Employment discrimination happens.** Even though it's illegal, data breaches don't care about laws. Imagine a future employer discovering your chronic pain history or mental health notes.

**Personal safety is at stake.** For abuse survivors, stalking victims, or anyone with conditions they prefer to keep private, leaked health data can be genuinely dangerous.

But beyond all the practical risks, there's something deeper here. Your health journey is yours. You should be able to track your pain, document your progress, and understand your patterns without becoming a data point in someone else's profit spreadsheet.

---

## What You Can Do Right Now

**Audit your current apps** using the questions above. Be ruthless—if an app fails the basic privacy test, delete it. Your data might already be out there, but you can stop the bleeding.

**Switch to privacy-respecting alternatives.** Yes, it's inconvenient to change apps and migrate data. Do it anyway. Your future self will thank you.

**Tell other people.** Share this with anyone you know who uses health apps. Most people have no idea what they're signing up for when they hit "Accept."

**Demand better.** Leave reviews calling out privacy violations. Contact developers. Support privacy legislation. The only way this changes is if we collectively refuse to accept surveillance as the price of healthcare technology.

---

## The Future We Could Build

The health tech industry has decided that your medical data is a product to be bought and sold. But that's not inevitable—it's a choice.

There are developers out there building alternatives. Tools that treat your pain diary like the intimate document it is, not like a data extraction opportunity. Software that respects your autonomy and understands that healthcare technology should serve patients, not exploit them.

The technology to build truly private health apps exists right now. The question is whether enough of us will demand it.

Your health data belongs to you. It always has. Maybe it's time the tech industry started acting like it.

## Try Something Different

If you're dealing with chronic pain and want to see what privacy-first software actually looks like, give [Pain Tracker](https://paintracker.ca) a try. It's free, it's open source, and your data genuinely stays on your device.

You can even check the code yourself on GitHub if you're skeptical. That's how this should work—transparency, not trust-me marketing.

Questions about any of this? Find me on GitHub or open a discussion. I'm always happy to talk about building healthcare technology that actually puts patients first.
